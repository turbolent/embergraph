/**
 * Interface for hard reference cache entries exposes a <i>dirty</i> flag in addition to the object
 * identifier and object reference.
 *
 * @author thompsonbry
 * @version $Id$
 * @todo Support clearing updated objects for hot cache between transactions. Add metadata boolean
 *     that indicates whether the object was modified since the cache was last cleared regardless of
 *     whether the object has since been installed on the persistence layer and marked as clean. The
 *     purpose of this is to support clearing of modified objects from the object cache when a
 *     transaction is aborted. Such objects must be cleared if they have been modified since they
 *     were installed in the cache regardless of whether they are currently dirty or not. Supporting
 *     this feature will probably require a hard reference Set containing the object identifier of
 *     each object that was marked as dirty in the cache since the cache was last cleared.
