 * @author thompsonbry
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo Support clearing updated objects for hot cache between transactions.
 *       Add metadata boolean that indicates whether the object was modified
 *       since the cache was last cleared regardless of whether the object has
 *       since been installed on the persistence layer and marked as clean. The
 *       purpose of this is to support clearing of modified objects from the
 *       object cache when a transaction is aborted. Such objects must be
 *       cleared if they have been modified since they were installed in the
 *       cache regardless of whether they are currently dirty or not. Supporting
 *       this feature will probably require a hard reference Set containing the
 *       object identifier of each object that was marked as dirty in the cache
 *       since the cache was last cleared.
