/*
* Interface for cache policy.
 *
 * <p>The semantics of this interface are generally specified in terms of a hard reference cache
 * backing a weak (or soft) reference cache. Examples of methods on the interface whose semantics
 * are determined by the hard reference cache include:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #iterator()} - visitation order and membership is determined by the backing hard
 *       reference cache.
 *   <li>{@link #entryIterator()} - visitation order and membership is determined by the backing
 *       hard reference cache.
 *   <li>{@link #size()} - membership is determined by the backing hard reference cache.
 *   <li>{@link #capacity()} - the capacity of the backing hard reference cache.
 *   <li>{@link #setListener()} - eviction notices are fired when entries are evicted from the hard
 *       reference cache.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The rationale for this is that the cache iterator methods are used to perform installs of dirty
 * objects from the cache onto the persistence layer during a commit. Since clear references are not
 * reachable, eviction notices are fired when entries are evicted from the hard reference cache.
 * Those notices must be used to install dirty objects onto the persistence layer, in which case the
 * entry for that object in the weak reference cache is marked as <em>clean</em>. When properly
 * integrated with the persistence layer, this provides a guarantee that the iterators will never
 * fail to visit a dirty entry in the cache. For consistency with the iterator methods, {@link
 * #size()} returns the number of entries in the hard reference cache. Neither visitation of nor
 * counting of all weak cache entries in and of itself is not a foreseen use case and those
 * semantics not supported by this interface.

 * @todo long oid to Object oid? The advantages of this are: (1) it allows us to create a flyweight
 *     object a long integer and pass it around, thereby avoiding many conditions under which we
 *     mint new Longs; (2) the OID math may be encapsulated on that flyweight object; (3) we can use
 *     a different OID object for each backend if necessary; (4) we can change the size of the OID
 *     more transparently since more code will not depend on it being a [long] data type. (The
 *     IGenericData would still use long internally.) (extSer might accept an Object for its
 *     writePackedOID() method).
 * @todo expose a means to test whether a cache entry is dirty, but consider the interactions
 *     implied for the weak value cache. one way to approach this is to expose getEntry( long key ).
 *     The problem with this is that it does not encapsulate the odder semantics of the weak value
 *     cache.
