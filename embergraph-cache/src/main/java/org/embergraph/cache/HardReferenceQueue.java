/*
* A cache for hard references using an LRU policy. References are simply cached, but objects are
 * not recoverable from their reference. In order to make an object recoverable, this cache must be
 * wrapped by a weak reference cache that implements a hash map for discovery of objects using their
 * persistent identifier. The {@link HardReferenceQueue} has a capacity that determines the #of hard
 * references that may be cached before an object is evicted from the cache. Objects may be stored
 * multiple times on the cache but the nscan most recent references are always tested before
 * appending a reference to the cache in order to minimize cache churn when an object is touched
 * repeatedly in close succession. Likewise, eviction does not mean that the object is no longer on
 * the hard reference cache, nor does eviction mean that no hard references to the object exist
 * within the VM. However, eviction is nevertheless used to drive persistence of the object. Since
 * an object may be evicted multiple times without being updated in between evictions, this requires
 * the object to implement a protocol for determining whether or not it is dirty. Eviction is then
 * contingent on that protocol and the dirty state of the object is reset when it is serialized for
 * eviction. In combination with the object's dirty protocol, the hard reference cache can
 * substitute for a commit list.
 *
 * <p>Note: This implementation is NOT synchronized.
