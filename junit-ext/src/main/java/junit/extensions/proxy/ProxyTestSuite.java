/**
 * A simple wrapper around {@link TestSuite} that permits the caller to specify the delegate {@link
 * Test} for either directly or recursively contained {@link IProxyTest}s added to a {@link
 * ProxyTestSuite}. There are three cases for junit:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>An instantiated test. This is an instance of some class that extends {@link TestCase}. If
 *       the class implements {@link IProxyTest} then the <i>delegate </i> will be set on the test
 *       instance and will be available when that test runs.
 *   <li>A test case. This is a class named to {@link TestSuite#addTestSuite(java.lang.Class)}. That
 *       method scans the test case class and generates an instantiated test for each conforming
 *       test method identified in the test case. The delegate is then set per above.
 *   <li>A test suite. The delegate declared in a {@link ProxyTestSuite} constructor will be flowed
 *       down to each test added either directly or indirectly to that {@link ProxyTestSuite}. The
 *       various constructors all invoke this method to flow down the delegate. In addition, the
 *       {@link #addTest(Test)} and {@link #addTestSuite(Class)} methods also invoke this method to
 *       flow down the delegate to instantiated tests that implement {@link IProxyTest}.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The only case when flow down does not occur is when you have created a standard test suite,
 * addeded it to a proxy test suite, and <em>then</em> you add additional tests to the standard test
 * suite. There is no event notification model in junit and this action is not noticed by the {@link
 * ProxyTestSuite}.
