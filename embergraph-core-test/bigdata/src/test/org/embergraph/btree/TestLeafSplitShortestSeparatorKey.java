     * On reflection, I suspect that this is an edge case which is simply not
     * covered by the code. I think that I can construct a unit test which will
     * demonstrate the failure and then work out the logic for the edge case.
     * <p>
     * The exception is being thrown when a leaf is full. The leaf is in a
     * temporary overflow condition. In order to split the leaf into a left
     * sibling and a right sibling, the tuples in the leaf are divided into two
     * by choosing the index of the first key which will enter the right
     * sibling. A separator key is chosen which guides search into either the
     * left sibling or the right sibling as appropriate and is then inserted
     * into the parent. The assertion was tripped because the chosen separator
     * key already existed in the parent. The code (Leaf#802) is attempting to
     * choose the shortest separator key because that makes the keys in the
     * nodes short, which reduces their on disk requirements. In fact, since we
     * also use prefix compression (front-coding of the keys) there is less
     * benefit to this than might otherwise be the case. Regardless, I believe
     * that the source of the error is the failure to consider the existing
     * separator key in the parent of the leaf which was directing search into
     * the leaf. In this case, it appears that the shortest separator key when
     * considering the last key in the left sibling and the first key in the
     * right sibling is identical to the pre-existing separator key in the
     * parent for the leaf before it is split. To fix this, I need to create a
     * unit test with data in a tree which replicates the assertion as an
     * existence proof of the problem and then change the logic to consider
     * three keys when determining the shortest separator key -- the existing
     * separator key in the parent node, the last key in the new left sibling,
     * and the first key in the new right sibling.
     * 
     * As a workaround, you can replace line 802:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * final byte[] separatorKey = BytesUtil.getSeparatorKey(//
     *         getKeys().get(splitIndex),//
     *         getKeys().get(splitIndex - 1)//
     *         );
     * </pre>
     * 
     * with
     * 
     * <pre>
     * final byte[] separatorKey = getKeys().get(splitIndex);
     * </pre>
     * 
     * This will use the first key in the new right sibling as the new separator
     * key in the parent between the new left and right sibling. That should be
     * correct, just a longer separator key.
