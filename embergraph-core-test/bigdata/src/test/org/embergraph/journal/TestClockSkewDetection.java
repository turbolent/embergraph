/**
 * Test suite for {@link ClocksNotSynchronizedException}. The basic pattern of
 * events is as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * leader   : t1          : timestamp before gather() messages are sent to followers.
 * follower :     t2      : timestamp taken when servicing gather() message and sent to leader with response.
 * leader   :         t3  : timestamp taken on leader when barrier breaks.
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Of necessity, these events have a temporal order (t1 BEFORE t2; t2 BEFORE
 * t3). However, there can be skew in the clocks such that the clock on the
 * leader and the clock on the follower(s) are not synchronized. Some clock skew
 * is allowed, but significant clock skew can cause a problem on failover.
 * <p>
 * The problem arises because the clocks are used to assign timestamps for
 * commit points, and we index into the journal using those timestamps for
 * historical reads (reading on the database as of some wall clock time).
 * <p>
 * {@link AbstractJournal#commitNow(long)} does ensure that time moves forward
 * relative to the timestamp associated with the last commit point on the
 * journal. However, if the skew is large, then this could require waiting for
 * minutes, hours, or days before a new commit time could be assigned.
 * <p>
 * In order to avoid such long latency during failover, an error is reported
 * proactively if a large clock skew is detected during the release time
 * consensus protocol.
 * <p>
 * This test suite verifies the logic for detecting clock skew.
 * 
 * @see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/bigdata/ticket/686" >
 *      Consensus protocol does not detect clock skew correctly </a>
