/**
 * Test suite for conformance with synchronous IO write requests made on a
 * {@link RandomAccessFile} opened using <code>rss</code> or <code>rdd</code>
 * mode. A conforming platform will NOT reorder writes and will a request to
 * {@link FileChannel#force(boolean)} will flush data through to stable media
 * before the write operation returns. A write cache in the operating system,
 * device driver, controller, or disk drive can defeat synchronous IO with the
 * results that: (a) the sequence in which writes are issued by the application
 * may not be the sequence in which the data are laid down on the disk; and (b)
 * the write operation may return before the data are stable on disk.
 * <p>
 * Both of these results can break the semantics of the atomic commit protocol
 * in at least the following ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li> If the root blocks are updated before the application data are on stable
 * media then a power failure will cause the application to read from the new
 * root block but the application data will not have been written.</li>
 * <li> If the write operation returns before the data are on stable media then
 * the application may conclude that the commit was successful when in fact the
 * data are not yet on disk. In fact, since the error is not reported
 * synchronously the application may never learn that the write has failed
 * unless it continues to write on the disk and a subsequent write turns up the
 * error.</li>
