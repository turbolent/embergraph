 * Test suite for the {@link HTreeHashJoinUtility}.
 * 
 * TODO Write a unit test which verifies that the ivCache is used and that the
 * cached {@link BigdataValue}s are correctly restored when the rightSolutions
 * had cached values and the leftSolutions did not have a value cached for the
 * same IVs. For example, this could be done with a cached value on an IV which
 * is not a join variable and which is only present in the rightSolutions.
