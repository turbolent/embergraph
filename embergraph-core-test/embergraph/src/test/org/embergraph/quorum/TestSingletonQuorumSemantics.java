   * Unit test for the voting protocol for a singleton quorum.

   * otherwise be expected (up to a few seconds versus a small fraction of a second). You can see
   * this in the timestamps of the logger.
   *
   * <p>The test terminates when the fixture tears down the AbstractQuorum's internal watcher action
   * service, which has a hung action. If the WatcherActionService is also single-threaded, then
   * this could clearly lead to a deadlock since there would be no thread available to handle new
   * events.
   *
   * <p>It is awaiting the quorumBreak condition in AbstractQuorumActor.clearToken(). This issue may
   * be that we have two distinct signals for quorumBreak versus quorumMeet which need to be
   * combined and then the various methods modified to also test the condition variable. [I've made
   * that change.]
   *
   * <p>It seems likely that either a concurrent watcherActionService -or- a finite timeout would
   * get the unit tests to pass. However, only the former would work around a deadlock due to a
   * stuck Condition.
   *
   * <p>Look again at what Condition is getting stuck and at the stress test in {@link
   * #main(String[])} for causes. [nhang=17, nerr=0, nrun=1000]. There are several different causes,
   * each of which clearly reflects a different ordering of the events.
   *
   * <p>It maybe that we see the problem with a singleton quorum because there are no other sources
   * of events to kick the quorum into motion again once it fails to join under the initial impetus.
   *
   * <p>The problem appears to stem from withdrawing the cast vote before the quorum meets.
