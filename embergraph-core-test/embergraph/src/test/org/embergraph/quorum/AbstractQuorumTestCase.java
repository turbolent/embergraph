   * Wait up to a timeout until some condition succeeds.
   *
   * <p>Whenever more than one {@link AbstractQuorum} is under test there will be concurrent
   * indeterminism concerning the precise ordering and timing as updates propagate from the {@link
   * AbstractQuorum} which takes some action (castVote(), pipelineAdd(), etc.) to the other quorums
   * attached to the same {@link MockQuorumFixture}. This uncertainty about the ordering and timing
   * state changes is not dissimilar from the uncertainty we face in a real distributed system.
   *
   * <p>While there are times when this uncertainty does not affect the behavior of the tests, there
   * are other times when we must have a guarantee that a specific vote order or pipeline order was
   * established. For those cases, this method may be used to await an arbitrary condition. This
   * method simply retries until the condition becomes true, sleeping a little after each failure.
   *
   * <p>Actions executed in the main thread of the unit test will directly update the internal state
   * of the {@link MockQuorumFixture}, which is shared across the {@link MockQuorum}s. However,
   * uncertainty about ordering can arise as a result of the interleaving of the actions taken by
   * the {@link QuorumWatcher}s in response to both top-level actions and actions taken by other
   * {@link QuorumWatcher}s. For example, the vote order or the pipeline order are fully determined
   * based on sequence such as the following:
   *
   * <pre>
   * actor0.pipelineAdd();
   * actor2.pipelineAdd();
   * actor1.pipelineAdd();
   * </pre>
   *
   * When in doubt, or when a unit test displays stochastic behavior, you can use this method to
   * wait until the quorum state has been correctly replicated to the {@link Quorum}s under test.
   *
