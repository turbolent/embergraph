     * @todo One of the critical things to verify is that the appropriate locks
     *       are being obtain before writing on an access path. Other than
     *       tracing this through the code, the best way to verify this is with
     *       a concurrent stress test. A failure to obtain the appropriate lock
     *       will show up as an error in the B+Tree due to concurrent
     *       modifications of the underlying data structures.
     *       <p>
     *       Indices are protected by one of two different mechanisms. (1) When
     *       a journal is used without regard to the concurrency manager, the
     *       {@link UnisolatedReadWriteIndex} is responsible for imposing the
     *       appropriate concurrency constraints. (2) When running on a data
     *       service, the {@link ConcurrencyManager} relies on the
     *       {@link LockManager} to serialize access to the mutable indices.
     *       <p>
     *       The query engine refactor needs to respect these same mechanisms in
     *       order to co-exist with the existing design patterns.
