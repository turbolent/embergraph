/*
* Class demonstrates the ability to declare get/set and get methods on the the {@link IFoo}
 * interface and expose a {@link Foo} implementation of that interface as a {@link StandardMBean}.
 * You can run {@link #main(String[])} and start <code>jconsole</code> and inspect/set the "foo"
 * attribute and see the change on the read-only "bar" attribute. No fuss, no muss.
 *
 * <p>There are some caveats. In general, you can declare interfaces having getters and directly
 * expose the services implementing those interfaces as MBeans. If the service supports a dynamic
 * change to the value of an attribute, then you can also put the settor on the interface to be
 * exposed as an MBean.
 *
 * <p>The get/set methods need to be <code>synchronized</code> so that changes made by a setter will
 * become immediately visible to other code also synchronized on the same reference. If the service
 * internally uses the getter, then consider having district objects on which you synchronize for
 * get() methods which are heavily used in order to minimize contention for the object's monitor.
 * The other option is to make the field for the attribute <code>volatile</code>.
 *
 * <p>Since MBean methods do not declare RMI exceptions there can be a conflict in the interface if
 * the method is also exposed for RMI, e.g., for a jini-based service. You need to have two
 * interfaces for this case.
 *
 * <p>There may be some cases where an attribute needs to be broken into a current value and a
 * target value, much like adjusting clocks to network time.
