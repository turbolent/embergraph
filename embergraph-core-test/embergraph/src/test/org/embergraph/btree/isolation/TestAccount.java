/**
 * This test case demonstrates a state-based validation technique described in
 * http://www.cs.brown.edu/~mph/Herlihy90a/p96-herlihy.pdf for a "bank account"
 * data type.
 * 
 * @todo There are several things that are different about this approach from my
 *       preconceptions.<br>
 *       First, there is a distinct between stable state (the account balance)
 *       and transaction local state (the low, high, and change for that account
 *       within the transaction).<br>
 *       This notion of validation is in terms of the objects API (credit and
 *       debit in this case) rather than in terms of writes of opaque state that
 *       are then unpacked when a write-write conflict is detected.<br>
 *       In the atomic commit protocol, validation examines transaction local
 *       state as well as the global state and updates the global state
 *       atomically iff validation succeeds.<br>
 *       This does not appear to depend on the notion of version counters to 
 *       trigger state-based 
 *       This raises lots of questions. I need to think through how a
 *       transaction containing multiple objects could be modeled, how this
 *       relates to what is already implemented, and the relationship between
 *       this approach and the notions that I have for handling link set
 *       membership and clustered index membership changes with high
 *       concurrency.
