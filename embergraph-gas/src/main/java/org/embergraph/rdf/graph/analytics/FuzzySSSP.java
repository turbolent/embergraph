/**
 * This algorithm provides a fuzzy implementation of the shortest paths between
 * a set of source vertices and a set of target vertices. This can be used to
 * identify a set of vertices that are close to the shortest paths between those
 * source and target vertices. For some domains, the resulting set of vertices
 * can be understood as an "interesting subgraph".
 * <p>
 * Problem: We want to find a set of not more than N vertices out of a data set
 * that are "close" to the shortest path between two sets of vertices.
 * <p>
 * Approach: We want to find the set of SP (Shortest Path) vertices that lie
 * along the shortest path between each source vertex and each target vertex. We
 * would also like to know whether a source is connected to each target. To do
 * this, we do NSOURCES SSSP traversals. For each traversal, we note the depth
 * of each target from each source, and mark the depth as -1 if the target was
 * not reachable from that source. The vertices along the shortest path to the
 * target are collected. The sets of collected vertices are merged and
 * duplicates are removed.
 * <p>
 * Finally, we do a BFS starting with all of the vertices in that merged
 * collection and stopping when we have N vertices, including those along the
 * shortest paths. This grows the initial set of vertices that lie along the
 * shortest paths into a broader collection of vertices that are close to that
 * shortest path.
 * <p>
 * Outputs: The N vertices, their distances from the shortest paths (which we
 * get out of the final BFS), and the distance of each target from each source
 * along the shortest path (which we get from the per-source SSSP traversals).
 * 
 * TODO Support breaking out of the analytic as soon as the frontier is known to
 * contain at least N(=2k) distinct vertices (or M=10k edges). Note that for
 * frontier implementations that allow duplicates, this means that you need to
 * wait for the end of the iteration to make the decision. We already support a
 * decision point at the end of each iteration. This would allow us to lift the
 * decision point inside of the iteration and terminate processing eagerly when
 * the frontier size exceeds a specified value.
 * 
 * TODO: Implement unit test with ground truth.
