/**
 * Interface exposes access to the VS and ES that is visible during a GATHER or

 * <p>
 * This interface is intended to be restrictive in both its API and the state
 * that the API will expose in order to facilitate scaling in multi-machine
 * environments.
 * <p>
 * A concrete implementation of this interface for a cluster WILL ONLY provide
 * O(1) access to vertices whose state has not been materialized on a given node
 * by a GATHER or SCATTER. State for vertices that were not materialized will
 * not be accessible.

 *            The generic type for the per-vertex state. This is scoped to the

 * @param <ES>
 *            The generic type for the per-edge state. This is scoped to the
 *            computation of the {@link IGASProgram}.
