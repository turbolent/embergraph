<title>GAS Engine for OpenRDF SAIL</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>This is an implementation of the GAS API for the openrdf SAIL. The
		performance of this package will depend strongly on the SAIL
		implementation. Good performance should be observed for SAILs that use
		Java objects in main memory when combined with large heaps and Java 7,
		which has the G1 garbage collector. Disk-base SAILs have overhead
		associated with IO Wait and with decoding and materializing objects
		from the indices. Main memory SAILs should attempt to minimize the
		creation of duplicate objects in order to improve memory utilization
		and memory bandwidth.</p>
