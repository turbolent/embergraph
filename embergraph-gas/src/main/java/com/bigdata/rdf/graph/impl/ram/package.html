<body>
	<p>This is an implementation of the GAS API for the Java concurrency
		class. This package is designed to have no object encoding and
		decoding overhead and to support high concurrency operations on the
		graph. It does NOT implement the SAIL. Instead, it provides an RDF
		graph abstraction using the openrdf data model that support efficient
		operations for the GAS API (basically, efficient access to the
		in-edges, out-edges, and attribute values).</p>
