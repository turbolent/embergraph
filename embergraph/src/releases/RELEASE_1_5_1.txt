Starting with the 1.5.0 release, SYSTAP’s graph database platform will be called Blazegraph™.   It is built on the same platform and maintains 100% binary and API compatibility with Bigdata®.   SYSTAP will be fully integrating the Blazegraph™ brand over the course of 2015 and all of the existing wiki, blog, and other related pages will be updated.  

This is a major release of Blazegraph™.  The official release is made into the Sourceforge Git repository.  Releases after 1.4.0 will no longer be made into SVN. [14].

Blazegraph™ is specifically designed to support big graphs offering both Semantic Web (RDF/SPARQL) and Graph Database (tinkerpop, blueprints, vertex-centric) APIs.   It features robust, scalable, fault-tolerant, enterprise-class storage and query and high-availability with online backup, failover and self-healing.  It is in production use with enterprises such as Autodesk, EMC, Yahoo7!, and many others.   Blazegraph™ provides both embedded and standalone modes of operation.  

Blazegraph™ is a horizontally-scaled, open-source architecture for indexed data with an emphasis on RDF capable of loading 1B triples in under one hour on a 15 node cluster.  It operates in both a single machine mode (Journal), highly available replication cluster mode (HAJournalServer), and a horizontally sharded cluster mode (Federation).  The Journal provides fast scalable ACID indexed storage for very large data sets, up to 50 billion triples / quads.  The HAJournalServer adds replication, online backup, horizontal scaling of query, and high availability.  The federation provides fast scalable shard-wise parallel indexed storage using dynamic sharding and shard-wise ACID updates and incremental cluster size growth.  Both platforms support fully concurrent readers with snapshot isolation.

Distributed processing offers greater throughput but does not reduce query or update latency.  Choose the Journal when the anticipated scale and throughput requirements permit.  Choose the HAJournalServer for high availability and linear scaling in query throughput.  Choose the BigdataFederation when the administrative and machine overhead associated with operating a cluster is an acceptable tradeoff to have essentially unlimited data scaling and throughput.

See [1,2,8] for instructions on installing bigdata(R), [4] for the javadoc, and [3,5,6] for news, questions, and the latest developments. For more information about SYSTAP, LLC and bigdata, see [7].

Starting with the 1.0.0 release, we offer a WAR artifact [8] for easy installation of the single machine RDF database.  For custom development and cluster installations we recommend checking out the code from SVN using the tag for this release. The code will build automatically under eclipse.  You can also build the code using the ant script.  The cluster installer requires the use of the ant script.

Starting with the 1.3.0 release, we offer a tarball artifact [10] for easy installation of the HA replication cluster.  

Starting with the 1.5.0 release, we offer an executable jar file [13] for getting started quickly with minimal setup.

You can download the WAR (standalone), JAR (executable), or HA artifacts from:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/bigdata/

You can checkout this release from:

git clone -b BIGDATA_RELEASE_1_5_1 --single-branch git://git.code.sf.net/p/bigdata/git BIGDATA_RELEASE_1_5_1


Feature summary:

- Highly Available Replication Clusters (HAJournalServer [10])
- Single machine data storage to ~50B triples/quads (RWStore);
- Clustered data storage is essentially unlimited (BigdataFederation);
- Simple embedded and/or webapp deployment (NanoSparqlServer);
- Triples, quads, or triples with provenance (RDR/SIDs);
- Fast RDFS+ inference and truth maintenance;
- Fast 100% native SPARQL 1.1 evaluation;
- Integrated "analytic" query package;

About Blazegraph™: 

Blazegraph™ is a horizontally-scaled, general purpose storage and computing fabric for ordered data (B+Trees), designed to operate on either a single server or a cluster of commodity hardware. Blazegraph™ uses dynamically partitioned key-range shards in order to remove any realistic scaling limits - in principle, Blazegraph™ may be deployed on 10s, 100s, or even thousands of machines and new capacity may be added incrementally without requiring the full reload of all data. The Blazegraph™ RDF database supports RDFS and OWL Lite reasoning, high-level query (SPARQL), and datum level provenance.
