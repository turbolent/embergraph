Blazegraph™ is our ultra high-performance graph database supporting Blueprints and RDF/SPARQL APIs. It supports up to 50 Billion edges on a single machine and has a High Availability and Scale-out architecture. It is in production use for Fortune 500 customers such as EMC, Autodesk, and many others.

This is a major release of Blazegraph™.  The official release is made into the Sourceforge Git repository.  Releases after 1.4.0 will no longer be made into SVN. 

Blazegraph Features (http://www.blazegraph.com/blazegraph#FeatureMatrix)

1.5.2 has significant performance improvements for query optimization and new features.  See https://blog.blazegraph.com/?p=905.

In this release, join group evaluation strategy compliant with the official http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query SPARQL W3C semantics. As a consequence, for some query patterns, the behavior of Blazegraph changed and if you’re upgrading your Blazegraph installation it might make sense to review your queries for such patterns, in order to avoid regressions.  See https://blog.blazegraph.com/?p=928 for more details.
