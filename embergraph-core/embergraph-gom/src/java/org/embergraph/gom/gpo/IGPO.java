/**
 * A generic object has identity and an extensible, loosely-typed property set.
 * When the value of a property is another generic object, the property models a
 * directed many-to-one association. Many-to-many linking patterns are modeled
 * using intermediate objects and a convenience API. Reverse navigation for
 * associations is automatically aggregated by the association target within a
 * {@link ILinkSet link set}. Associations and link sets provide an uniform,
 * efficient and scalable API for object navigation. Link sets may be
 * {@link ILinkSetIndex indexed }for efficient search.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Extensible behavior is realized by wrapping up a generic object within some
 * application specific interface. Generic object implementations should be
 * considered as <code>final</code>. Specific backends may support
 * subclassing but use of subclassing will lock an application into a specific
 * GOM platform. Instead applications layer additional behavior onto generic
 * objects using "skins" - see {@link #asClass( Class )}. A skin delegates the
 * management of persistent state to a backing generic object. The use of skins
 * provides transparent migration of application code across different GOM
 * implementations.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The generic object model provides transparent and scalable persistence when
 * using an appropriate backing store. The backing store is selected and
 * configured using the {@link ObjectManagerFactory}.
 * <p>
