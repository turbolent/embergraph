/*
* Interface for the data record of a hash directory. A hash directory provides an address space. In
 * a hash table, all of the children are buckets. In a hash tree, children may be either buckets or
 * directories. If the hash tree is balanced, then all children on the same level are of the same
 * type (either buckets or directories). If the hash tree is unbalanced, then children may be of
 * either type on a given level.
 *
 * <p>The hash directory provides an index which maps a subset of the bits in a hash value onto a
 * directory entry. The directory entry provides the storage address of the child page to which a
 * lookup with that hash value would be directed. The directory entry also indicates whether the
 * child is a bucket or another directory. This requires 1-bit per directory entry, which amounts to
 * an overhead of 3% when compared to a record which manages to encode the bucket / directory
 * distinction into the storage address.
 *
 * <p>The number of entries in a hash directory is a function of the globalDepth of that directory:
 * <code>entryCount := 2^globalDepth</code>. The globalDepth of a child directory is its localDepth
 * in the parent directory. While the localDepth of a <em>persistent</em> child may be computed by
 * scanning and counting the #of references to that child, the copy-on-write policy used to support
 * MVCC for the hash tree requires that the storage address of a dirty child is undefined.
 * Therefore, the localDepth MUST be explicitly stored in the directory record. Assuming 32-bit hash
 * codes, this is a cost of 4 bits per directory entry which amounts to a 11% overhead when compared
 * to a record which manages to encode that information using a scan of the directory entries.
 *
 * <p>By far the largest storage cost associated with a directory page are the addresses of the
 * child pages. Embergraph uses <code>long</code> addresses for the {@link IRawStore} interface.
 * However, it is possible to get by with int32 addresses when using the RWStore.
 *
 * <p>Finally, embergraph uses checksums on all data records. Therefore the maximum space available
 * on a 4k page is actually 4096-4 := 4094 bytes. [Yikes! This means that we can not store power of
 * 2 addresses efficiently. That means that we really need to use a compressed dictionary
 * representation in order to have efficient storage utilization with good fan out.]
