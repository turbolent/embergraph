/**
 * A non-remote interface for a service which will participate in a quorum as a
 * member service (as opposed to a client service that merely watches the
 * quorum). The methods on this interface are aware of the service {@link UUID}
 * of the member service and can report on its role and relationships in the
 * {@link Quorum}. In order to <em>act</em> on the distributed quorum state, the
 * {@link QuorumMember} will issue various commands to its {@link QuorumActor}.
 * <p>
 * This interface defines a collection of messages which are used to inform the
 * {@link QuorumMember} of significant changes in the distributed quorum state
 * as it pertains to <i>this</i> quorum member. See {@link QuorumStateChangeListener}.

     * A service operating as a {@link QuorumMember} has both {@link Remote}
     * interface and a non-remote interface. These interfaces typically define
     * similar methods (for example, compare {@link org.embergraph.ha.HACommitGlue}, which is
     * {@link Remote}, with {@link QuorumCommit}, which is non-remote). The
     * {@link Remote} interface in turn will have a local implementation object
     * inside of the JVM and an exported proxy for that {@link Remote}
     * interface. This method returns the <em>local</em> implementation object
     * for the {@link Remote} interface and is intended to facilitate operations
     * which the {@link QuorumMember} executes against its own {@link Remote}
     * interface. While the {@link Remote} interface will be exposed to other
     * services using a proxy, how that happens is outside of the scope of this
     * method.
