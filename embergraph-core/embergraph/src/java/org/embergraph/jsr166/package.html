Utility classes related derived from <a href="http://g.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest/">JSR 166</a>.
Classes in this package MAY have been modified to support specific tasks in
bigdata.  In particular, new constructors may provide a means to declare a Lock
to the class such that the same lock can be shared with another class.  This
pattern breaks encapsulation of the JSR class design decisions with regard to
locks and signals, but it enables patterns which are otherwise not possible
without creating deadlock through holding an outer lock while waiting on the
inner lock within the JSR class.  This sort of pattern/problem exists in the
BlockingBuffer and ChunkedRunningQuery classes.  By using modified versions
of the JSR classes we can work around the problem using an appropriate pattern.
