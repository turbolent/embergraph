/*
 * Interface for methods that return or accept an ordinal index into the entries in the B+-Tree. The
 * semantics of this interface are build over the #of spanned tuples for each child as recorded
 * within each node of the B+Tree. This provides a fast means to compute the linear index into the
 * B+Tree of any given tuple. However, this interface is only available for a local B+Tree object
 * (versus scale-out) since the spanned tuple count metadata is not exact across shards. Further,
 * when delete markers are used, the deleted tuples remain in the B+Tree and the {@link ILinearList}
 * interface will continue to count them until they have been purged. Thus deleting a tuple does not
 * change the {@link #indexOf(byte[])} keys after that tuple, {@link #keyAt(long)} can return the
 * key for a deleted tuple, and {@link #valueAt(long)} will return <code>null</code> if the tuple at
 * that index is marked as deleted within the B+Tree.

   *     inserted into the btree without intervening mutations. Note that this guarantees that the
   *     return value will be >= 0 if and only if the key is found. When found the index will be in
   *     [0:nentries). Adding or removing entries in the tree may invalidate the index.
   *     <p><code>pos = -(pos+1)</code> will convert an insertion point to the index at which the
