/**
 * <p>
 * An index (or index partition) that has been isolated by a transaction.
 * Isolation is achieved by the following mechanisms:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The writeSet of the transaction on the index is isolated on a
 * {@link BTree} visible only to that transaction.</li>
 * <li>Version timestamps are maintained for index entries in both the isolated
 * write set and groundState from which the transaction is reading.</li>
 * <li>The groundState is defined as the view of the index (partition) as of the
 * abs(startTime) of the transaction.</li>
 * <li>Reads are performed against an ordered view defined by the writeSet
 * followed by the ordered set of indices defining the groundState of the index.
 * </li>
 * <li>Writes first read through the ordered view to locate the most recent
 * version for an index entry. If the index entry is located in the isolated
 * writeSet then it is overwritten and its timestamp is unchanged. If the index
 * entry is located in the groundState then the timestamp is copied from that
 * index entry and written on the new version in the isolated writeSet.</li>
 * <li>During validation, version timestamps in the isolated writeSet are
 * compared against the then current view of the corresponding unisolated index.
 * If the timestamp in the unisolated view differs from that in the writeSet
 * then there is a write-write conflict. Write-write conflicts MAY be validated
 * if the index has a registered {@link IConflictResolver}.</li>
 * <li>If the writeSet is validated then it is mergedDown (copied onto) the then
 * current unisolated index view. During the mergeDown phase the revision
 * timestamp of the transaction is applied to all index entries copied from the
 * write set. Transactions that later try to commit will recognize write-write
 * conflicts based on those updated timestamps. Note that revision timestamps
 * ARE NOT commit timestamps. Revision timestamps are assigned at the start of
 * the validation phase. All tuples modified by a transaction are annotated with
 * the same revision timestamp during the validation phase of the transaction.
 * Write-write conflicts are detected on the basis of the per-tuple revision
 * timestamps. Commit timestamps are assigned once the write set has been
 * validated and checkpointed and all shards participating in the commit
 * protocol signal that they are prepared and ready to commit.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: The timestamp from which the post-commit state of the transaction may
 * be read IS NOT defined for an {@link IEmbergraphFederation}. It is not possible
 * to define this timestamp without requiring concurrent commit processing to be
 * paused on all data services on which the transaction has written, which is
 * viewed as too high a cost. Instead, the commit timestamp is the state from
 * which you can read the data written by the transaction. Reads on tuples NOT
 * updated by the transaction MAY have been changed by concurrent transactions.
 * </p>
 * Note: The process of validating, merging down changes, and committing those
 * changes MUST be atomic. Therefore no other operations may be permitted access
 * to the unisolated indices corresponding to the isolated indices on which the
 * transaction during this process. This constraint is generally achieved by
 * holding a write lock on the unisolated indices corresponding to the indices
 * isolated by the transaction, e.g., by declaring those indices to an
 * {@link ITx#UNISOLATED} {@link AbstractTask} which handles this process. </p>
