* Memory-mapped journal strategy (this mode is NOT recommended).
 *
 * <p>Note: the use of {@link FileLock} with a memory-mapped file is NOT recommended by the JDK as
 * this combination is not permitted on some platforms.
 *
 * <p>Note: Extension and truncation of a mapped file are not possible with the JDK since there is
 * no way to guarentee that the mapped file will be unmapped in a timely manner. Journals that
 * handle {@link IJournal#overflow()} should trigger overflow just a bit earlier for a {@link
 * MappedByteBuffer} in an attempt to avoid running out of space in the journal. If a transaction
 * can not be committed due to overflow, it could be re-committed <em>after</em> handling the
 * overflow event (e.g., throw a "CommitRetryException").
 *
 * <p>The mapped mode has nearly the performance of the transient mode in some tests. However the
 * use of mapped files might not prove worth the candle due to the difficulties with resource
 * deallocation for this strategy and the good performance of some alternative strategies. There are
 * also some other issues that have shown up in some of the tests suites -- look carefully if you
 * are going to pursue this!
