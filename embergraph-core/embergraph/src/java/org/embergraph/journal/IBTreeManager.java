/**
 * Interface for management of local index resources such as {@link BTree},

 * The GIST support has been pushed down into the {@link IGISTLocalManager}. The
 * {@link BTree} and {@link IIndex} specific methods on this interface are a
 * mixture of convenience and support for scale-out and should eventually be
 * phased out of this interface. The interface itself could be renamed to
 * something along the lines of "IIndexLocalManager".

     * Note: This variant is generally by the {@link IMetadataService} when it
     * needs to register a index partition of some scale-out index on a
     * {@link IDataService}. In this case the <i>name</i> is the name of the

     * {@link IndexMetadata#getName()} is the name of the scale-out index. In
     * nearly all other cases you can use {@link #registerIndex(IndexMetadata)}
     * instead. The same method signature is also declared by
     * {@link IDataService#registerIndex(String, IndexMetadata)} in order to
     * support registration of index partitions.
     * <p>
     * Note: Due to the method signature, this method CAN NOT be used to create
     * and register persistence capable data structures other than an
     * {@link IIndex} (aka B+Tree).
     * 
     * @param name
     *            The name that can be used to recover the index.

     *      to create and register persistence capable data structures other
     *      than an {@link IIndex} (aka B+Tree). It is difficult to reconcile
     *      this method with other method signatures since this method is
     *      designed for scale-out and relies on {@link IIndex}. However, only
     *      the B+Tree is an {@link IIndex}. Therefore, this method signature
     *      can not be readily reconciled with the {@link HTree}. The only
     *      interface which the {@link BTree} and {@link HTree} share is the
     *      {@link ICheckpointProtocol} interface, but that is a purely local
     *      (not remote) interface and is therefore not suitable to scale-out.
     *      Also, it is only in scale-out where the returned object can be a
     *      different type than the simple {@link BTree} class, e.g., a
     *      {@link FusedView} or even an {@link IClientIndex}.
