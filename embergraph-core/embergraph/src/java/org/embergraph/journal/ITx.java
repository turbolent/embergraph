   *
   * <p>If you want a scale-out index to be read consistent over multiple operations, then use
   * {@link IIndexStore#getLastCommitTime()} when you specify the timestamp for the view. The index
   * will be as of the specified commit time and more recent commit points will not become visible.
   *
   * <p>{@link AbstractTask}s that run with read-committed isolation provide a read-only view onto
   * the most recently committed state of the indices on which they read. However, when a process
   * runs a series of {@link AbstractTask}s with read-committed isolation the view of the index in
   * each distinct task will change if concurrenct processes commit writes on the index (some
   * constructs, such as the scale-out iterators, provide read-consistent views for the last commit
   * time). Further, an index itself can appear or disappear if concurrent processes drop or
   * register that index.
   *
   * <p>A read-committed transaction imposes fewer constraints on when old resources (historical
   * journals and index segments) may be released. For this reason, a read-committed transaction is
   * a good choice when a very-long running read must be performed on the database. Since a
   * read-committed transaction does not allow writes, the commit and abort protocols are identical.
   *
   * <p>However, split/join/move operations can cause locators to become invalid for read-committed
   * (and unisolated) operations. For this reason, it is often better to specify "read-consistent"
   * semantics by giving the lastCommitTime for the {@link IIndexStore}.
