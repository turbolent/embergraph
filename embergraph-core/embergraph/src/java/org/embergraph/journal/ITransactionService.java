/*
 * An interface for managing transaction life cycles.
 *
 * <h2>Concurrency control</h2>
 *
 * <p>The underlying concurrency control mechanism is Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC).
 * There are no "write locks" per say. Instead, a transaction reads from a historical commit point
 * identified by its assigned start time (abs(transactionIdentifier) is a timestamp which identifies
 * the commit point) and writes on an isolated write set visible only to that transaction. When a
 * read-write transaction commits, its write set is validated against the then current committed
 * state of the database. If validation succeeds, the isolated write set is merged down onto the
 * database. Otherwise the transaction is aborted and its write set is discarded. (It is possible to
 * register an index with an {@link IConflictResolver} in order to present the application with an
 * opportunity to validate write-write conflicts using state-based techniques, i.e., by looking at
 * the records and timestamps and making an informed decision).
 *
 * <p>A transaction imposes "read locks" on the resources required for the historical state of the
 * database from which that transaction is reading (both read-only and read-write transactions
 * impose read locks). Those resources will not be released until the transaction is complete or
 * aborted. The transaction manager coordinates the release of resources by advancing the global
 * release time - the earliest commit time from which a transaction may read. Under dire
 * circumstances (disk shortage) the transaction manager MAY choose to abort transactions and
 * advance the release time in order to permit the release of locked resources and the reclamation
 * of their space on local disk.
 *
 * <h2>Centralized transaction manager service</h2>
 *
 * <p>When deployed as a distributed database there will be a centralized service implementing this
 * interface and clients will discover and talk with that service. The centralized service in turn
 * will coordinate the distributed transactions with the various {@link IDataService}s using their
 * local implementations of this same interface. The centralized transaction service SHOULD invoke
 * the corresponding methods on a {@link IDataService} IFF it knows that the {@link IDataService} is
 * buffering writes for the transaction.
 *
 * <h2>Timestamps</h2>
 *
 * <p>Both read-only and read-write transactions assert global read locks on the resources required
 * for that historical state of the database corresponding to their start time. Those read locks are
 * released when the transaction completes. Periodically the transaction manager will advance the
 * release time, rendering views of earlier states of the database unavailable.
 *
 * <p>The transaction identifier codes the transaction <em>start time</em>. The transaction start
 * time is chosen from among those distinct timestamps available between the specified commit time
 * and the next commit time on the database. Successive read-write transactions must be assigned
 * transaction identifiers whose absolute value is strictly increasing - this requirement is
 * introduced by the MVCC protocol.
 *
 * <p>The sign of the transaction identifier indicates whether the transaction is read-only
 * (positive) or read-write (negative). Read-only transaction identifiers may be directly used as
 * commit times when reading on a local store. Read-write transaction identifiers must have their
 * sign bit cleared in order to read from their ground state (the commit point corresponding to
 * their transaction start time) but the unmodified transaction identifier is used to access their
 * mutable view (the view comprised of the write set of the transaction super imposed on the ground
 * state such that writes, overwrites, and deletes are visible in the view).
 *
 * <p>The symbolic value {@link ITx#READ_COMMITTED} and any <code>startTime</code> MAY be used to
 * perform a lightweight read-only operations either on a local data service or on the distributed
 * database without coordination with the {@link ITransactionService}, but resources MAY be released
 * at any time since no read "locks" have been declared. While a read-write transaction may be
 * readily identified by the sign associated with the transaction identifier, you CAN NOT
 * differentiate between a read-only transaction (with read-locks) and a lightweight read on a given
 * commit time. In practice, it is only the transaction manager which needs to recognize read-only
 * transactions and then only to constrain its assignment of distinct transaction identifiers and to
 * coordinate the advance of the release time as transactions end. There is no other practical
 * difference between read-only transactions and lightweight reads from the perspective of either
 * the client or the individual data services as read-locks are managed solely through the
 * advancement of the release time by the transaction manager.
