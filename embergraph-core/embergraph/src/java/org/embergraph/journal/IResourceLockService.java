/**
 * Interface named synchronous distributed locks without deadlock detection.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * FIXME Two features need to be teased apart. On the one hand there are full
 * tx, which provide deadlock detection and could support hierarchical locking
 * (with changes to the lock manager to decouple threads from lock queues, the
 * imposition of a path syntax on the resource names, and perhaps the
 * introduction of 2PL lock modes {S,I,X}). This lock manager could then be
 * exposed, providing applications with the possibility of 2PL, but bigdata does
 * not require that in and of itself (it might be of interest for others).
 * <p>
 * The other feature is distributed locks without deadlock detection. This is
 * the kind of lock that you get with zookeeper. When running in a single JVM
 * java.util.concurrent.locks provides this kind of locking. These locks are
 * good for coordinating actions such as who is the master in some computation.
 * <p>
 * This second role (global synchronous locks without deadlock detection) can be
 * realized by a client library. When running in a single JVM, the
 * java.util.concurrent.locks package can provide the implementation. When
 * running in a distributed environment, zookeeper can provide the
 * implementation.
 * 
 * FIXME The main use of this interface today is creating and destroying
 * relations, relation containers, and their indices "atomically". Unisolated
 * operations CAN NOT be used to create more than a single resource atomically.
 * A full tx should be used instead. The place where this happens is
 * {@link AbstractResource#acquireExclusiveLock()}. That is invoked only when
 * creating or destroying a resource. All callers should be using a full tx
 * instead when creating or destroying a resource!
