   * This version supports the {@link RWStore} as well as the log-structured journal store. The
   * {@link RWStore} includes meta-allocation blocks, allocation blocks, and delete blocks (chains
   * of addresses which can be freed in the allocation blocks when the corresponding commit record
   * is discarded).
   *
   * <p>The new fields for this version include:
   *
   * <dl>
   *   <dt>storeType
   *   <dd>A byte value which specifies whether the backing store is a journal (log-structured store
   *       or WORM) or a read-write store. Only two values are defined at present. See {@link
   *       StoreTypeEnum}. The default value of this field before {@link #VERSION1} is {@link
   *       StoreTypeEnum#WORM}.
   *   <dt>metaBitsAddr
   *   <dd>Where we will read the metadata bits from. When we start the store up we need to retrieve
   *       the metabits from this address. This is a byte offset into the file and is stored as a
   *       long integer. Normal addresses are calculated with reference to the allocation blocks.
   *       The value for a WORM store and the default value before {@link #VERSION1} are both ZERO
   *       (0).
   *   <dt>metaStartAddr
   *   <dd>The start of the area of the file where the allocation blocks are allocated. This is also
   *       a byte offset into the file and is stored as a 64-bit integer. It is called metaStartAddr
   *       because that is the offset that is used with the metaBitsAddr to determine how to find
   *       the allocation blocks. The value for a WORM store and the default value before {@link
   *       #VERSION1} are both ZERO (0).
   * </dl>
   *
   * In addition, the semantics of the following fields are different for the {@link RWStore}
   *
   * <dl>
   *   <dt>nextOffset
   *   <dd>For the {@link RWStore}, this the next offset in file from which a large chunk would be
   *       allocated in order to obtain space for additional allocation blocks. This field does not
   *       change when user level allocations are made.
   *   <dt>offsetBits
   *   <dd>This field is ignored by the {@link RWStore}.
   * </dl>
   *
   * The head of the delete block chain is stored in the {@link ICommitRecord} so we know the
   * address of the start of each delete block chain for each commit point on the store, which is
   * why it is not stored in the root blocks.
