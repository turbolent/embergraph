/**
 * <p>
 * A low-level interface for reading and writing data. This interface is not
 * isolated and operations do not possess ACID semantics. Implementations may or
 * may not be durable. All operations are expressed in terms of long integers
 * that are often called "addresses" but which should be understood as opaque
 * identifiers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link AbstractJournal} is the principal implementation of this interface
 * and provides both transient and durable options and the facilities for atomic
 * commit. {@link BTree} provides a higher level interface for operations on an
 * {@link IRawStore} and uses a copy-on-write policy designed to support
 * transactional semantics by making it possible to read from a consistent
 * historical state. The {@link AbstractJournal} provides the necessary
 * mechanisms to support transactions based on the copy-on-write semantics of
 * the {@link BTree}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link IRawStore} supports write and read back on immutable addresses and
 * does NOT directly support update of data for an immutable address once that
 * data has been written. Applications seeking Create, Read, Update, Delete
 * (CRUD) semantics should use a {@link BTree} to store their application data.
 * Unlike this interface, the {@link BTree} can correctly support update and
 * delete of application data using a persistent identifier (the key).
 * </p>

 *      FIXME This should be restated in terms of {@link IByteArrayBuffer}. The
 *      use of the {@link ByteBuffer} in this API has become limiting. It would
 *      be nicer to specify a byte[] with optional offset and length parameters.
 *      This would make it easier to wrap the byte[] in different ways for
 *      reading and writing. The {@link ByteBuffer} has an advantage when
 *      reading since it allows us to return a read-only view of the record, but
 *      in practice that is only effective for an in-memory store (with or
 *      without a backing file). The byte[] is more flexible. The caller is free
 *      to reuse the byte[] and the store always copies the data. In practice,
 *      we tend to work around this by copying to an array backed
 *      {@link ByteBuffer} or to a byte[] wrapped as an {@link IByteArrayBuffer}
 *      .
