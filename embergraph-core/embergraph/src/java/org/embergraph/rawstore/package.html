<title>Raw Store</title>

<p>
A set of interfaces and some simple implementations for a read-write
store without atomic commit or transactions.  The {@link
org.embergraph.journal.Journal} provides an implementation of this {@link
IRawStore} interface that supports atomic commit and is restart-safe.
</p>
<p>
There are some trivial implementations in the test suite that are used
for bootstrapping classes with a dependency on {@link IRawStore}, such
as the {@link org.embergraph.objndx.BTree}, without introducing a dependency
on the {@link org.embergraph.journal.Journal}.
