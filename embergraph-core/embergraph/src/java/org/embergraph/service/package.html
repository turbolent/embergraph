<p>
This package provides implementations of embergraph services (metadata
service, data service, transaction manager service.
</p>

<p>
A embergraph federation is comprised of the following essential
services:

<dl>

<dt>metadata service</dt><dd>The metadata service manages scale-out indices
and is used to locate index partitions.</dd>

<dt>data service</dt><dd>The data service supports reads and writes on
index partitions.</dd>

</dl>

Clients are responsible for discovering the metadata service.  Clients
then use the metadata service to manage scale-out indices and to
locate and cache leases for data service instances having data for key
range partitions that the client will read or write.  If a client will
use transactions (vs ACID batch operations), then the client must also
locate the transaction manager service. Service location is performed
using JINI, but other service locator protocols are possible.
</p>

<p>

embergraph provides the following optional services.  These are not
considered essential since (a) they are not required by clients that
make direct use of embergraph as a distributed database; and (b) they are
themselves applications of the services briefly described above.

<dl>

<dt>transaction manager service</dt><dd>Clients use the transaction
manager service to start new transactions and to coordinate the
distributed commit protocol.  The transaction manager also provides a
centralized timestamp factory.</dd>

<dt>map and reduce service</dt><dd>Manages the distributed execution of a
functional program.</dd>

</dl>

</p>

<h2>deployment</h2>

<p>

In order to deploy a embergraph federation, the following preconditions
must be met (a standalone deployment can be realized by meeting these
preconditions on a single host).  This will go more smoothly if JINI
is running before you start the various embergraph services since they
will then be able to register themselves immediately on
startup. Service discovery by default uses the local network and the
"public" group. If you want to run more than one embergraph federation on
the same network, then you MUST edit the configuration file.

</p>

<p>
Hosts:

<ul>

<li>java 5 or better is installed.  The use of a server VM is highly
recommended.  The following options are recommended for some well
known VMs: <dl>

<dt>Sun</dt><dd>-server -Xms1g -Xmx1g -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=256M</dd>

<dt>JRockit</dt><dd>-Xms1g -Xmx1g</dd>

</dl>

@todo review the use of -Xms (sets the initial heap size).  How much
of a difference does this make?  Note that JRockit defaults to 75% of
physical memory or 1G, which ever is less.</li>

<li>the embergraph-server distribution is installed.</li>

<li>the data service is running.</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>
In addition, there must be at least one host on which the following
preconditions are true (a different host could be used for each of
these services, and more than one instance of these services may be
running on the network).  These services should be started during the
boot procedure so that they are available whenever the host is up and
running.

<ul>

<li>jini 2.x is installed and running.  This will be used to register
and lookup services.  It helps if jini is running before you try to
start the embergraph services since they will be able to register
themselves immediately in that case.</li>

<li>a metadata server is running.</li>

<li>one or more data server(s) are running.</li>

<li>a transaction server is running (optional).</li>

<li>one or more map and reduce servers are running (optional).</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>
Clients:

<ul>

<li>java 5 or better is installed.  The use of a server VM
is highly recommended</li>

<li>the embergraph-client deployment package is installed.  This includes
embergraph-client.jar, but also support for generating unicode keys
(ICU4J), etc.</li>

</ul>

</p>

<h2>unique identifiers</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Data Service</dt><dd><p>The serviceID identifies the data
service. If the service dies and then restarts on the same host with
the same data, then it is still the same service instance. If the
service dies and is recreated on another host with the same data, then
it is still the same instance. What is important is that (a) the
service has the same data (journals, index segments, and serviceID);
and (b) that the data for that service has not become <em>stale</em>
(or inconsistent).</p><p> The easiest way in which the data can become
stale is for the service to fail.  When failover is operating, clients
will be redirected to one or more other services having consistent
data for the same index partitions.  If clients then write on _any_ of
those index partitions and commit, then the old service now has stale
(aka inconsistent) data. A service with inconsistent data MUST NOT be
used.
</p><p>In general, the majority of state for a service will live in
its index segments.  This can be hundreds or thousands of times more
data in the index segments than there is in any single journal.  This
can make it worth while to make the service consistent again.
</p></dd>

<dt>Journal</dt><dd>Each journal has a UUID that is generated when the
journal is created (it is stored in the root block).  This serves to
uniquely identify the journal as a resource regardless of where it may
be located on the host or in the file system.</dd>

<dt>Index Segment</dt><dd>Each index segment has a UUID that is
generated when the index segment is created (it is stored in the fixed
length index segment metadata record).  This serves to uniquely
identify the index segment as a resource regardless of where it may be
located on the host or in the file system.</dd>

<dt>Index</dt><dd>Named indices are assigned UUIDs when they are
created.  This makes it possible to rename an index, since its UUID
remains the same.</dd>

<dt>metadata service</dt><dd></dd>

<dt>transaction manager service</dt><dd></dd>

<dt>job scheduler service</dt><dd></dd>

</dl>


<h2>downloaded code</h2>

<p>

While embergraph makes use of jini for service registration and
discovery, it does not use downloaded code for executing its basic
services (the necessary interfaces and implementation classes are
already bundled in embergraph.jar). However, clients MAY use downloaded
code in order to have data servers execute remote procedures or
extension batch operations.  In this scenario, the client will create
and register a JINI service.  The service should perform <em>all</em>
of its operations locally.  The data server will lookup the service
using jini and then execute it locally.
</p>

<p>
In order for downloaded code to work correctly, clients must ensure
that their classes are exposed by an HTTP server accessible to embergraph
servers and declared to the VM in which the client starts using:
	  	
<code>-Djava.rmi.server.codebase=...</code>

</p>

<p>

@todo consider this use case further. Are there other/better ways for
executing remote code on the data server?  At a minimum, we should
supply a base class and ant script support for creating such remote
services.
