/**
 * The data service interface provides remote access to named indices, provides for both unisolated
 * and isolated operations on those indices, and exposes the {@link ITxCommitProtocol} interface to
 * the {@link ITransactionManagerService} service for the coordination of distributed transactions.
 * Clients normally write to the {@link IIndex} interface. The {@link ClientIndexView} provides an
 * implementation of that interface supporting range partitioned scale-out indices which
 * transparently handles lookup of data services in the metadata index and mapping of operations
 * across the appropriate data services.
 *
 * <p>Indices are identified by name. Scale-out indices are broken into index partitions, each of
 * which is a named index hosted on a data service. The name of an index partition is given by
 * {@link DataService#getIndexPartitionName(String, int)}. Clients are <em>strongly</em> encouraged
 * to use the {@link ClientIndexView} which encapsulates lookup and distribution of operations on
 * range partitioned scale-out indices.
 *
 * <p>The data service exposes both fully isolated read-write transactions, read-only transactions,
 * lightweight read-historical operations, and unisolated operations on named indices. These choices
 * are captured by the timestamp associated with the operation. When it is a transaction, this is
 * also known as the transaction identifier or <i>tx</i>. The following distinctions are available:
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>Unisolated
 *   <dd>
 *       <p>Unisolated operation specify {@link ITx#UNISOLATED} as their transaction identifier.
 *       Unisolated operations are ACID, but their scope is limited to the commit group on the data
 *       service where the operation is executed. Unisolated operations correspond more or less to
 *       read-committed semantics except that writes are immediately visible to other operations in
 *       the same commit group.
 *       <p>Unisolated operations that allow writes obtain an exclusive lock on the live version of
 *       the named index for the duration of the operation. Unisolated operations that are declared
 *       as read-only read from the last committed state of the named index and therefore do not
 *       compete with read-write unisolated operations. This allows unisolated read operations to
 *       achieve higher concurrency. The effect is as if the unisolated read operation runs before
 *       the unisolated writes in a given commit group since the impact of those writes are not
 *       visible to unisolated readers until the next commit point.
 *       <p>Unisolated write operations MAY be used to achieve "auto-commit" semantics when
 *       distributed transactions are not required. Fully isolated transactions are useful when
 *       multiple operations must be composed into a ACID unit.
 *       <p>While unisolated operations on a single data service are ACID, clients generally operate
 *       against scale-out indices having multiple index partitions hosted on multiple data
 *       services. Therefore client MUST NOT assume that an unisolated operation described by the
 *       client against a scale-out index will be ACID when that operation is distributed across the
 *       various index partitions relevant to the client's request. In practice, this means that
 *       contract for ACID unisolated operations is limited to either: (a) operations where the data
 *       is located on a single data service instance; or (b) unisolated operations that are
 *       inherently designed to achieve a <em>consistent</em> result. Sometimes it is sufficient to
 *       configure a scale-out index such that index partitions never split some logical unit - for
 *       example, the {schema + primaryKey} for a {@link SparseRowStore}, thereby obtaining an ACID
 *       guarentee since operations on a logical row will always occur within the same index
 *       partition.
 *   <dt>Light weight historical reads
 *   <dd>Historical reads are indicated using <code>tx</code>, where <i>tx</i> is a timestamp and is
 *       associated with the closest commit point LTE to the timestamp. A historical read is fully
 *       isolated but has very low overhead and does NOT require the caller to open the transaction.
 *       The read will have a consistent view of the data as of the most recent commit point not
 *       greater than <i>tx</i>. Unlike a distributed read-only transaction, a historical read does
 *       NOT impose a distributed read lock. While the operation will have access to the necessary
 *       resources on the local data service, it is possible that resources for the same timestamp
 *       will be concurrently released on other data services. If you need to map a read operation
 *       across the distributed database, the you must use a read only transaction which will assert
 *       the necessary read-lock.
 *   <dt>Distributed transactions
 *   <dd>Distributed transactions are coordinated using an {@link ITransactionManagerService}
 *       service and incur more overhead than both unisolated and historical read operations.
 *       Transactions are assigned a start time (the transaction identifier) when they begin and
 *       must be explicitly closed by either an abort or a commit. Both read-only and read-write
 *       transactions assert read locks which force the retention of resources required for a
 *       consistent view as of the transaction start time until the transaction is closed.
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface MUST be thread-safe. Methods declared by this interface MUST
 * block for each operation. Client operations SHOULD be buffered by a thread pool with a FIFO
 * policy so that client requests may be decoupled from data service operations and clients may
 * achieve greater parallelism.
 *
 * <h2>Index Partitions: Split, Join, and Move</h2>
 *
 * <p>Scale-out indices are broken tranparently down into index partitions. When a scale-out index
 * is initially registered, one or more index partitions are created and registered on one or more
 * data services.
 *
 * <p>Note that each index partitions is just an {@link IIndex} registered under the name assigned
 * by {@link DataService#getIndexPartitionName(String, int)} and whose {@link
 * IndexMetadata#getPartitionMetadata()} returns a description of the resources required to compose
 * a view of that index partition from the resources located on a {@link DataService}. The {@link
 * IDataService} will respond for that index partition IFF there is an index under that name
 * registered on the {@link IDataService} as of the <i>timestamp</i> associated with the request. If
 * the index is not registered then a {@link NoSuchIndexException} will be thrown. If the index was
 * registered and has since been split, joined or moved then a {@link StaleLocatorException} will be
 * thrown (this will occur only for index partitions of scale-out indices). <strong>All methods on
 * this and derived interfaces which are defined for an index name and timestamp MUST conform to
 * these semantics.</strong>
 *
 * <p>As index partitions grow in size they may be <em>split</em> into 2 or more index partitions
 * covering the same key range as the original index partition. When this happens a new index
 * partition identifier is assigned by the metadata service to each of the new index partitions and
 * the old index partition is retired in an atomic operation. A similar operation can <em>move</em>
 * an index partition to a different {@link IDataService} in order to load balance a federation.
 * Finally, when two index partitions shrink in size, they maybe moved to the same {@link
 * IDataService} and an atomic <i>join</i> operation may re-combine them into a single index
 * partition spanning the same key range.
 *
 * <p>Split, join, and move operations all result in the old index partition being dropped on the
 * {@link IDataService}. Clients having a stale {@link PartitionLocator} record will attempt to
 * reach the now defunct index partition after it has been dropped and will receive a {@link
 * StaleLocatorException}.
 *
 * <h2>{@link StaleLocatorException}</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link IDataService} clients MUST handle this exception by refreshing their cached {@link
 * PartitionLocator} for the key range associated with the index partition which they wish to query
 * and then re-issuing their request. By following this simple rule the client will automatically
 * handle index partition splits, joins, and moves without error and in a manner which is completely
 * transparent to the application. Note that splits, joins, and moves DO NOT alter the {@link
 * PartitionLocator} for historical reads, only for ongoing writes. This exception is generally (but
 * not always) wrapped. Applications typically DO NOT write directly to the {@link IDataService}
 * interface and therefore DO NOT need to worry about this. See {@link ClientIndexView}, which
 * automatically handles this exception.
 *
 * <h2>{@link IOException}</h2>
 *
 * <p>All methods on this and derived interfaces can throw an {@link IOException}. In all cases an
 * <em>unwrapped</em> exception that is an instance of {@link IOException} indicates an error in the
 * Remote Method Invocation (RMI) layer.
 *
 * <h2>{@link ExecutionException} and {@link InterruptedException}</h2>
 *
 * <p>An <em>unwrapped</em> {@link ExecutionException} or {@link InterruptedException} indicates a
 * problem when running the request as a task in the {@link IConcurrencyManager} on the {@link
 * IDataService}. The exception always wraps a root cause which may indicate the underlying problem.
 * Methods which do not declare these exceptions are not run under the {@link IConcurrencyManager}.
 *
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * @todo add support for triggers? unisolated triggers must be asynchronous if they will take
 *     actions with high latency (such as writing on a different index partition, which could be
 *     remote). Low latency actions might include emitting asynchronous messages. transactional
 *     triggers can have more flexibility since they are under less of a latency constraint.
