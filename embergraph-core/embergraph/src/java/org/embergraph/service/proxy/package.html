<p>

This package provides implementations of proxy objects for commonly used
classes.  These proxy objects are designed to have exactly the same API
as the original objects.  They DO NOT extend {@link java.rmi.Remote} and
they DO NOT declare {@link IOException} or any other exceptions which
are not declared by their original interface declarations. This allows
us to write code that uses the same API for RMI and non-RMI cases.
