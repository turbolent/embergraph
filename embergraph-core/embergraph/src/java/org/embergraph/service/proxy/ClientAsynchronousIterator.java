/**
 * Wraps an {@link RemoteAsynchronousIterator} so that it looks like an
 * {@link IAsynchronousIterator} again.
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses the caller's {@link ExecutorService} to run a task
 * that migrates data from the remote {@link IAsynchronousIterator} into a local
 * {@link BlockingBuffer}. The client implementation uses purely local
 * operations to test the contents of the local {@link BlockingBuffer}. This
 * means that operations like {@link #hasNext(long, TimeUnit)} may be used with
 * short timeouts without possibility of blocking IO.
 * <p>
 * Note: This class is NOT thread-safe. There should be only a single process
 * draining the iterator.
 * <p>
 * Note: In order to conserve resources, the caller is advised to use
 * {@link #start(ExecutorService)} before making any other requests. This will
 * allow the caller to specify an {@link ExecutorService} that will be tasked
 * with buffering elements from the {@link RemoteAsynchronousIterator}. When
 * {@link #start(ExecutorService)} is not invoked explicitly, a new
 * {@link Thread} will be allocated. Typically, an {@link ExecutorService} can
 * be much more efficient than creating a new {@link Thread}.
 * 
 * @todo Note that we only use three methods to implement
 *       {@link ClientAsynchronousIterator} - hasNext(timeout,unit),
 *       isExhausted(), and next(). The rest of the
 *       {@link RemoteAsynchronousIterator} API does not need to be implemented.
