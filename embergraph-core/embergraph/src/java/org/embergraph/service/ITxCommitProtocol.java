   *
   * <p>When the {@link IDataService} is sent the {@link #prepare(long, long)} message it executes a
   * task which will handle commit processing for the transaction. That task MUST hold exclusive
   * locks for the unisolated indices to which the transaction write sets will be applied. While
   * holding those locks, the task must first validate the transaction's write set and then merge
   * down the write set onto the corresponding unisolated indices using the specified
   * <i>revisionTime</i> and checkpoint the indices in order to reduce all possible sources of
   * latency. Note that each {@link IDataService} is able to independently prepare exactly those
   * parts of the transaction's write set which are mapped onto index partitions hosted by a given
   * {@link IDataService}.
   *
   * <p>Once validation is complete and all possible steps have been taken to reduce sources of
   * latency (e.g., checkpoint the indices and pre-extending the store if necessary), the task
   * notifies the {@link ITransactionService} that it has prepared using {@link
   * ITransactionService#prepared(long)}. The {@link ITransactionService} will wait until all tasks
   * have prepared. If a task CAN NOT prepare the transaction, then it MUST throw an exception out
   * of its {@link #prepare(long, long)} method.
   *
   * <p>Once all tasks have send an {@link ITransactionService#prepared(long)} message to the {@link
   * ITransactionService}, it will assign a commitTime to the transaction and permit those methods
   * to return that commitTime to the {@link IDataService}s. Once the task receives the assigned
   * commit time, it must obtain an exclusive write lock for the live journal (this is a higher
   * requirement than just an exclusive lock on the necessary indices and will lock out all other
   * write requests for the journal), register the checkpointed indices on the commit list and then
   * request a commit of the journal using the specified commitTime. The task then notifies the
   * transaction service that it has completed its commit using {@link
   * ITransactionService#committed(long)} and awaits a response. If the {@link ITransactionService}
   * indicates that the commit was not successful, the task rolls back the live journal to the prior
   * commit point and throws an exception out of {@link #prepare(long, long)}.
   *
   * <p>A sample flow for successful a distributed transaction commit is shown below. This example
   * shows two {@link IDataService}s on which the client has written. (If the client only writes on
   * a single data service then we use a single-phase commit protocol).

   *   |
   * </pre>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>[1] The client issues an {@link ITransactionService#commit(long)} request, in which it
   *       specifies the transaction identifier (tx).
   *   <li>[2,3] The transaction service issues concurrent {@link #prepare(long, long)} requests to
   *       the participating {@link IDataService}s, specifying the transaction identifier (tx) and
   *       the revision timestamp (rev) to be used and then waits at a barrier until it receives
   *       {@link ITransactionService#prepared(long)} messages from those {@link IDataService}s.
   *   <li>[4] When all participants have prepared, the barrier breaks and the {@link
   *       ITransactionService} assigns a <i>commitTime</i> and returns that commitTime as the
   *       return value for the prepared messages.
   *   <li>[5,6] Once the {@link IDataService} obtains that commitTime, it proceeds with its atomic
   *       commit using the specified commitTime and then sends an {@link
   *       ITransactionService#committed(long)} message to the {@link ITransactionService}.
   *   <li>[7] The {@link ITransactionService} waits at another barrier.
   *   <li>[8,10] Once it has received an {@link ITransactionService#committed(long)} message from
   *       each participating {@link IDataService} the transaction has been successfully committed
   *       and the barrier breaks. The {@link ITransactionService} now lets the {@link
   *       ITransactionService#committed(long)} messages return <code>true</code>, indicating
   *       success.
   *   <li>[9,11] The {@link IDataService}s return (void) from their {@link #prepare(long, long)}
   *       message and the threads running their side of the commit protocol halt.
   *   <li>[12] The {@link ITransactionService} returns the commit time which it assigned and which
   *       was used by each participating {@link IDataService} to the client.
   * </ul>
   *
   * There are many points in the protocol where commit processing can fail. However, there are two
   * primary failure classifications that are of interest for error handling. Up until the first
   * barrier is satisified, there is no side-effect on the persistent state so error handling need
   * only halt processing on the {@link IDataService}s and discard any local state associated with
   * the transaction and throw an exception out of {@link #prepare(long, long)}. Once the first
   * barrier has been satisfied, persistent side-effects MAY occur. Error handling in this case must
   * rollback the state of the live journal for each of the participating {@link IDataService}s. If
   * error handling was performed in response to a local error, then the {@link IDataService} must
   * throw that error out of {@link #prepare(long, long)}. However, if error handling was initiated
   * because {@link ITransactionService#committed(long)} returned <code>false</code> then it should
   * return normally (after rolling back the journal).
   *
   * @param tx The transaction identifier.
   * @param revisionTime The timestamp that will be written into the {@link ITuple}s when the write
   *     set of the validated transaction is merged down onto the unisolated indices.
   * @throws Throwable if there is a problem during the execution of the commit protocol by the
   *     {@link IDataService}.
   * @throws IOException if there is an RMI problem.
   * @todo it may be possible to set the desired commit time on the abstract task (or a subclass
   *     specific to the distributed commit protocol) and then use that timestamp rather than
   *     requesting one from the {@link ITransactionService} in the group commit. This would allow
   *     us to use the normal commit processing.
   *     <p>If each distributed transaction gets its own commit time then we can not allow more than
   *     one distributed transaction into a given commit group. Therefore it seems that the {@link
   *     ITransactionService} would have to be able to assign the same commitTime to a set of
   *     distributed transactions that it knew were prepared together and would commit together. I
   *     can't quite see how that would work.
   *     <p>Failing that, we will need to exclude other tasks (or at least other distributed commit
   *     processing tasks) from the commit group.
