/**
 * Class supports range query across one or more index partitions. Each
 * partition is mapped onto a single {@link DataServiceTupleIterator} query. In
 * turn, the {@link DataServiceTupleIterator} may make several queries to the
 * data service per partition. The actual #of queries made to the data service
 * depends on the #of index entries that are visited per partition and the
 * capacity specified to the ctor. {@link StaleLocatorException}s are handled
 * transparently by restarting the locator scan and continuing the range query
 * request from the successor (or predecessor for a reverse scan) of the last
 * key visited. When the operation is unisolated, this class will correctly
 * complete the range iterator request even if the index partition is split,
 * joined or moved during traversal.
