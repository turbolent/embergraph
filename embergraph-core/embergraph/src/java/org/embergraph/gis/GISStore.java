/*
 * This is a placeholder for a GIS design. While GIS systems are typically R-trees, I am considering
 * an approach that leverages the existing scale-out B+-Tree architecture using a design similar in
 * many ways to the triple store.
 *
 * <p>There would be a feature dictionary with a foward and reverse map assigning feature
 * identifiers. The feature identifiers should problably reserve the lower 2-3 bits for coarse
 * coding of broad feature categories so that they may be filtered on those categories without
 * having to resolve them against the feature dictionary - filtering on the feature dictionary is a
 * scattered read.
 *
 * <p>The core indices would use keys formed as <code>lat, lon, alt, feature</code>. The feature
 * needs to show up in the key since there can be more than one feature at the same spatial
 * location. Alternative indices would provide for different access paths for the same key, but the
 * feature would always appear in the last key position giving 3 indices (unless scan of all
 * locations for a feature is common in which case this gives 6 indices, much like a quad store).
 *
 * <p>The value for the coordinate indices could either be unusued or could be a row identifier,
 * much like the sid of the triple store, for making metadata statements about a specific
 * {coordinate,feature} tuple. Other flags might also be carried on the value, but note that the
 * value is replicated on each coordinate access path.
 *
 * <p>If coordinates are entered into the database as of their "event" time then this design would
 * make it easy to obtain the set of spatial features for a given moment in time using a historical
 * read for that event time. However, this is likely to prove difficult when aggregating historical
 * data so the temporary dimension may also need to enter into the key: <code>
 * lat, lon, alt, time, feature</code>
 *
 * <p>I am assuming that latitude, longitude, altitude, and time can all be 64-bit long values
 * assigned from a standard representation such as decimal degrees, meters above/below sea-level,
 * and UTC milliseconds. Equally the (X,Y,Z) could be a polar coordinate system. This is really one
 * level above the data model. Regardless, and unlike the triple store, this means that most of the
 * tuple is directly generated from "natural" units without the aid of a dictionary. Only the
 * feature identifiers are assigned by a dictionary.
 *
 * <p>Features need to be extensible metadata that can be used to link together the spatial extent
 * of both stationary and moving "objects" (tracks). Features could doubtless be related together in
 * additional ways, e.g., through part-whole relations, either within the GIS or in an external
 * metadata database.
 *
 * <p>The basic queries would be things such as "Find me all features F of category X within REGION
 * (X,Y,Z) between TIME (T1,T2)." This would be coded as a JOIN of the various coordinate indices
 * with a filter (where appropriate) on the bits coding coarse feature categories within the
 * identifier and a scatter query doing fine-grained filtering against the reverse map of the
 * feature dictionary.
 *
 * @todo impl. sketch using refactor of the triple store.
 * @todo comparison with R-tree based approaches and practical GIS designs.
 * @todo consideration to metadata mashups.
 * @todo consideration to data sources and visualization tool chains for demo purposes.
 * @todo consideration to reconcilation of feature identity and spatial-temporal locator error for
 *     reporting of tracks.
 * @todo consideration to very high concurrency for read/write, including "consistent" writes,
 *     read-behind from consistent database states, and large #ofs tracks (10^6) with no less than
 *     60 seconds update periods.
