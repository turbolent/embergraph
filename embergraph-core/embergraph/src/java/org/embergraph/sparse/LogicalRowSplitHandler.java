/**
 * This class imposes the constraint that the separator key must not split a logical. This
 * constraint is required in order for the logical row store to retain its row-wise ACID semantics
 * when there is more than one shard for that row store. This is done using a linear scan forward
 * from the recommended splitAt index until the first tuple is identified which would be part of a
 * different logical row. The index of that tuple is returned.
