/**

 * backing a {@link SparseRowStore} into an {@link ITupleIterator} visiting
 * logical {@link ITPS} rows.
 * 
 * @todo Look at the remove semantics for the sparse row store. This would have
 *       to delete the logical row, or at least all property values that were
 *       materialized from the logical row. in fact, since this is a many:one
 *       transform, we must override the remove() impl for the inner class on
 *       {@link TupleTransformer}.
 * 
 * @todo You could replace the {@link AtomicRowRead} with this iterator by
 *       setting the capacity to ONE (1). However, that will do more work when
 *       we are only trying to read a single row on a local index since we will
 *       have to serialize and then de-serialize the {@link TPS} for that
 *       logical row. (For a remote read the effort should be the same).
