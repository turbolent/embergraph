/**
 * An iterator that is able visit items in chunks. The elements in the chunk
 * will be in the same order that they would be visited by
 * {@link Iterator#next()}. The size of the chunk is up to the implementation.
 * <p>
 * Note: Chunked iterators are designed to make it easier to write methods that
 * use the batch APIs but do not require the data that will be visited by the
 * iterator to be fully materialized. You can use {@link #nextChunk()} instead
 * of {@link Iterator#next()} to break down the operation into N chunks, where N
 * is determined dynamically based on how much data the iterator returns in each
 * chunk and how much data there is to be read.
 * 
 * @todo verify that all {@link IChunkedIterator}s are being closed within a
 *       <code>finally</code> clause.
