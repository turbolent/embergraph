/**
 * Interface for access to, and release of, a direct {@link ByteBuffer} managed by the {@link
 * DirectBufferPool}. A "direct" buffer is a region from the C heap of the native JVM process. Such
 * buffers can be efficient for NIO. They are also efficient when the application needs to store
 * large amounts of data without putting pressure on the Garbage Collector.
 *
 * <p><strong>CAUTION: Applications MUST use specific patterns when they work with the {@link
 * DirectBufferPool}</strong> Applications which acquire an {@link IBufferAccess} object
 * <em>MUST</em> hold a hard reference to that {@link IBufferAccess} while they are using the
 * associated memory block. Failure to follow this pattern WILL result in the backing {@link
 * ByteBuffer} being returned to the {@link DirectBufferPool} while the application is still using
 * the {@link ByteBuffer} (GC will drive this). This situation will lead to corruption for data
 * stored within the {@link ByteBuffer} if the buffer recycled and handed off once again via {@link
 * DirectBufferPool#acquire()}.
