   * Create/open the file and obtain an exclusive lock.
   *
   * <p>A {@link FileLock} will be used when supported and requested. An advisory lock will be used
   * if <i>useFileLock == false</code>, if the <i>fileMode</i> is read-only. If tryLock() returns
   * <code>null</code> then the lock exists and this request will fail. However, if {@link
   * FileChannel#tryLock()} throws an {@link IOException} then the underlying platform does not
   * support {@link FileLock} for the named file (memory mapped files, read-only files, and NFS
   * mounted files can all have this problem) and we will attempt to acquire an advisory lock
   * instead.
   *
   * <p><strong>Advisory locks are NOT visible to other applications</strong>
   *
   * <p>Do NOT request a {@link FileLock} if you are going to use a memory-mapped buffer. The JDK
   * cautions that these things do not play well together on some platforms.
   *
   * @param file The file.
   * @param fileMode The file mode for {@link RandomAccessFile#RandomAccessFile(File, String)}
   * @param useFileLock <code>true</code> if {@link FileChannel#tryLock()} should be attempted. when
   *     <code>false</code> only an advisory lock will be sought.
   * @return The {@link RandomAccessFile}
   * @throws IOException If the file could not be opened or someone already holds a lock for that
   *     file.
   * @see FileMetadata#acquireAdvisoryLock(File)
   * @see Options#FILE_LOCK_ENABLED
   * @todo we really don't need locks for temporary files.
   * @todo handle lock files during {@link StoreManager} startup.
   * @todo if you use a {@link FileLock} to open a file then you are protected.
   * @todo this ignores locks for read only file modes. in fact we should create the file with a
   *     read-only marker and allow more than one process to obtain that lock.
