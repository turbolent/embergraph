/**
 * A description of the metadata state for a partition of a scale-out index.
 *
 * <p>Each index partition has a distinct partitionId. This partitionId is assigned by a centralized
 * service - the {@link IMetadataService} for the scale-out index for that index partition. A
 * centralized service is required in order to obtain distinct int32 partition identifiers because
 * those partition identifiers are used in turn to support scale-out partition local {@link
 * ICounter}s - the partitionId forms the upper word of the int64 counter value.
 *
 * <p>The scale-out index name and the left and right separator keys are a complete identifier for
 * an index partition - any two index partitions which share those three properties MUST be the same
 * index partition. However, access to index partitions is generally in terms of the name of the
 * scale-out index and the partitionId. See {@link DataService#getIndexPartitionName(String, int)}
 * which returns the name under which an index partition will be registered and the name that must
 * be used when requesting operations on that index partition using an {@link IDataService}.
 *
 * <p>An index partition has additional state, including:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the {@link IDataService} on which it resides.
 *   <li>the {@link IResourceMetadata}[] describing the resources required to materialize a view of
 *       the index partition.
 *   <li>those resources themselves, which contain the index partition data.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The left and right separator keys define the half-open key range of the index partition. The
 * separator keys are available directly as the <i>keys</i> of the {@link MetadataIndex}, therefore
 * they are not stored in the index partition records within the metadata index. However, the
 * separator keys are stored in the index partition description within the {@link IndexMetadata}
 * records so that they are available locally with the index partition data.
 *
 * <p>If the client knows a key or key range of interest for a scale-out index then they can obtain
 * the relevant index partition descriptions and a data service locator either either by flooding
 * the query to the {@link IDataService}s or from the {@link MetadataIndex}.
