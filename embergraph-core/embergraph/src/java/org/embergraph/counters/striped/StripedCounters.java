/**
 * Abstract base class and template for striped counters designed for high
 * concurrency with eventual consistency and approximate read back without CAS
 * contention.
 * <p>
 * Each instance of this class in use by the application is backed by an array
 * of N instances protected by striped locks. You {@link #acquire()} an instance
 * and then directly manipulate the value of the counters on that instance. When
 * you {@link #release()} the instance, the counters MAY be published to the
 * outer instance visible to your application using
 * {@link #add(StripedCounters)}. This is similar to an eventually consistent
 * transactional model, except that there are no constraints on the validity of
 * the updates imposed by this scheme.
 * <p>
 * If reads will be made against the shared instance without holding a lock,
 * then the individual counters should be volatile fields, {@link AtomicLong},
 * or the like so that updates will be visible each time
 * {@link #add(StripedCounters)} is invoked by {@link #release()} will be
 * published in a timely manner.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * 
 * @todo The problem with this approach is that we can not decide that some
 *       counters should be published immediately while others should be
 *       published only every M touches [this might be something which can be
 *       hacked for specific counters using an incFoo() or addFoo() method for
 *       that counter which always updates the value on the parent if invoked on
 *       a striped counter.]
