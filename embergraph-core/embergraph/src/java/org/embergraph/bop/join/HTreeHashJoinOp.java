/**
 * A hash join against an {@link IAccessPath} based on the {@link HTree} and suitable for very large
 * intermediate result sets. Source solutions are buffered on the {@link HTree} on each evaluation
 * pass. When the memory demand of the {@link HTree} is not bounded, the hash join will run a single
 * pass over the {@link IAccessPath} for the target {@link IPredicate}. For some queries, this can
 * be more efficient than probing as-bound instances of the target {@link IPredicate} using a nested
 * indexed join, such as {@link PipelineJoin}. This can also be more efficient on a cluster where
 * the key range scan of the target {@link IPredicate} will be performed using predominately
 * sequential IO.
 *
 * <p>If the {@link PipelineOp.Annotations#MAX_MEMORY} annotation is specified then an evaluation
 * pass over the target {@link IAccessPath} will be triggered if, after having buffered some chunk
 * of solutions on the {@link HTree}, the memory demand of the {@link HTree} exceeds the capacity
 * specified by that annotation. This "blocked" evaluation trades off multiple scans of the target
 * {@link IPredicate} against the memory demand of the intermediate result set.
 *
 * <p>The source solutions presented to a hash join MUST have bindings for the {@link
 * HashJoinAnnotations#JOIN_VARS} in order to join (they can still succeed as optionals if the join
 * variables are not bound).
 *
 * <h2>Handling OPTIONAL</h2>
 *
 * An optional join makes life significantly more complex. For each source solution we need to know
 * whether or not it joined at least once with the access path. A join can only occur when the
 * source solution and the access path have the same as-bound values for the join variables.
 * However, the same as-bound values can appear multiple times when scanning an access path, even if
 * the access path does not allow duplicates. For example, an SPO index scan can many tuples with
 * the same O. This means that we can not simply remove source solution when they join as they might
 * join more than once.
 *
 * <p>While it is easy enough to associate a flag or counter with each source solution when running
 * on the JVM heap, updating that flag or counter when the data are on a persistent index is more
 * expensive. Another approach is to build up a second hash index (a "join set") of the solutions
 * which joined and then do a scan over the original hash index, writing out any solution which is
 * not in the joinSet. This is also expensive since we could wind up double buffering the source
 * solutions. Both approaches also require us to scan the total multiset of the source solutions in
 * order to detect and write out any optional solutions. I've gone with the joinSet approach here as
 * it reduces the complexity associated with update of a per-solution counter in the hash index.
 *
 * <p>Finally, note that "blocked" evaluation is not possible with OPTIONAL because we must have ALL
 * solutions on hand in order to decide which solutions did not join. Therefore {@link
 * PipelineOp.Annotations#MAX_MEMORY} must be set to {@link Long#MAX_VALUE} when the {@link
 * IPredicate} is {@link IPredicate.Annotations#OPTIONAL}.
