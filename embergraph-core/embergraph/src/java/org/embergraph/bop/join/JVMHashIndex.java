         * section when the ChunkTask ends. If the latch is then exposed to the
         * BOpContext, the operator can decide that it is the last invocation
         * and that no other task is running (or will run) for that operator and
         * then execute the post-processing step (flooding the solutions in the
         * hash index to the downstream operator in the query plan). [Actually,
         * we might not have to do that for the JVMHashIndexOp since we do not
         * have to checkpoint the JVMHashIndex and could incrementally pass
         * along the indexed solutions to the downstream operator, but this
