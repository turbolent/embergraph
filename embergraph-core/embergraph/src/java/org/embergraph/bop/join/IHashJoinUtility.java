/**
 * Interface for hash index build and hash join operations.
 *
 * <h2>Use cases</h2>
 *
 * For a JOIN, there are two core steps, plus one additional step if the join is optional. The hash
 * join logically has a <em>Left Hand Side</em> (LHS) and a Right Hand Side (RHS). The RHS is used
 * to build up a hash index which is then probed for each LHS solution. The LHS is generally an
 * access path scan, which is done once. A hash join therefore provides an alternative to a nested
 * index join in which we visit the access path once, probing the hash index for solutions which
 * join.
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>Accept solutions
 *   <dd>This step builds the hash index, also known as the RHS (Right Hand Side).
 *   <dt>hash join
 *   <dd>The hash join considers each left solution in turn and outputs solutions which join. If
 *       optionals are required, this step also builds an hash index (the <i>joinSet</i>) over the
 *       right solutions which did join.
 *   <dt>Output optionals
 *   <dd>The RHS hash index is scanned and the <i>joinSet</i> is probed to identify right solutions
 *       which did not join with any left solution. Those solutions are output as "optionals".
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p>This class also supports DISTINCT SOLUTIONS filters. For this use case, the caller uses {@link
 * #filterSolutions(ICloseableIterator, BOpStats, IBuffer)} method.

  /**
   * Perform an N-way merge join. For an OPTIONAL join, <i>this</i> instance is understood to be the
   * index having the "required" solutions.
   *
   * <p>The merge join takes a set of solution sets in the some order and having the same join
   * variables. It examines the next solution in order for each solution set and compares them. For
   * each solution set which reported a solution having the same join variables as that earliest
   * solution, it outputs the cross product and advances the iterator on that solution set.
   *
   * <p>The iterators draining the source solution sets need to be synchronized such that we
   * consider only solutions having the same hash code in each cycle of the MERGE JOIN. The
   * synchronization step is different depending on whether or not the MERGE JOIN is OPTIONAL.
   *
   * <p>If the MERGE JOIN is REQUIRED, then we want to synchronize the source solution iterators on
   * the next lowest key (aka hash code) which they all have in common.
   *
   * <p>If the MERGE JOIN is OPTIONAL, then we want to synchronize the source solution iterators on
   * the next lowest key (aka hash code) which appears for any source iterator. Solutions will not
   * be drawn from iterators not having that key in that pass.
   *
   * <p>Note that each hash code may be an alias for solutions having different values for their
   * join variables. Such solutions will not join. However, only solutions having the same values
   * for the hash code can join. Thus, by proceeding with synchronized iterators and operating only
   * on solutions having the same hash code in each round, we will consider all solutions which
   * COULD join with one another in each round.
   *
   * <p>Note: If the solutions are not in a stable and mutually consistent order by hash code in the
