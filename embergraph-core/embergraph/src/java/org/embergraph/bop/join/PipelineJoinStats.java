     * </pre>
     * 
     * It is ZERO (0) when {@link #inputSolutions} is ZERO (0).
     * <p>
     * The join hit ratio is always accurate when the join is fully executed.
     * However, when a cutoff join is used to estimate the join hit ratio a
     * measurement error can be introduced into the join hit ratio unless
     * {@link Annotations#COALESCE_DUPLICATE_ACCESS_PATHS} is <code>false</code>,
     * {@link Annotations#MAX_PARALLEL} is GT ONE (1), or
     * {@link Annotations#MAX_PARALLEL_CHUNKS} is GT ZERO (0).
     * <p>
     * When access paths are coalesced because there is an inner loop over the
     * input solutions mapped onto the same access path. This inner loop the
     * causes {@link PipelineJoinStats#inputSolutions} to be incremented by the
     * #of coalesced access paths <em>before</em> any {@link #outputSolutions}
     * are counted. Coalescing access paths therefore can cause the join hit
     * ratio to be underestimated as there may appear to be more input solutions
     * consumed than were actually applied to produce output solutions if the
     * join was cutoff while processing a set of input solutions which were
     * identified as using the same as-bound access path.
     * <p>
     * The worst case can introduce substantial error into the estimated join
     * hit ratio. Consider a cutoff of <code>100</code>. If one input solution
     * generates 100 output solutions and two input solutions are mapped onto
     * the same access path, then the input count will be 2 and the output count
     * will be 100, which gives a reported join hit ration of <code>100/2</code>
     * when the actual join hit ratio is <code>100/1</code>.
     * <p>
     * A similar problem can occur if {@link Annotations#MAX_PARALLEL} or
     * {@link Annotations#MAX_PARALLEL_CHUNKS} is GT ONE (1) since input count
     * can be incremented by the #of threads before any output solutions are
     * generated. Estimation error can also occur if multiple join tasks are run
     * in parallel for different chunks of input solutions.
