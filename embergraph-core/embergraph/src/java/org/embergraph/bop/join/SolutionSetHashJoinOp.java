/*
 * Operator joins a solution set modeled as a hash index into the pipeline. The solution set may be
 * modeled by an {@link HTree} or a JVM {@link HashMap}. While this JOIN requires the RHS hash index
 * to be fully materialized, evaluation of the LHS source solutions is pipelined.
 *
 * <p>Parallel evaluation of source chunks is permitted, but the RHS hash index must have been
 * checkpointed before this operator begins evaluation (the read-only {@link HTree} is thread-safe
 * for concurrent readers). The checkpoint is a NOP for the thread-safe JVM {@link
 * ConcurrentHashMap} collection class.
 *
 * <p>A {@link HTree} solution set must be be constructed by a {@link HTreeNamedSubqueryOp} or a
 * {@link HTreeHashIndexOp}. A JVM solution set must be constructed by a {@link JVMNamedSubqueryOp}
 * or {@link JVMHashIndexOp}.
 *
 * <h2>Handling OPTIONAL, EXISTS, and NOT-EXISTS</h2>
 *
 * {@link PipelineOp.Annotations#LAST_PASS} evaluation MUST be requested for any other than a {@link
 * JoinTypeEnum#Normal}. See {@link ChunkTask#doLastPass(UnsyncLocalOutputBuffer)} for details.
 *
 * <p>TODO This class could be made concrete. There is no logic it in that is specific to either the
 * {@link HTree} or JVM hash join operation.
