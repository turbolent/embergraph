 *         <P>
 *         I am not sure that we will require this. We can probably use the
 *         {@link SolutionSetStream} for named solution sets for quite a while
 *         without supporting declaration of named solution sets with specific
 *         join variables. However, if we do add support for this, then we need
 *         to reconcile the {@link HTree} version with the hash join code and
 *         {@link INamedSolutionSetRef} and also add an {@link IAccessPath} for
 *         {@link HTree} and {@link Stream} backed solution sets so they can be
 *         played out through a simple iterator model. The {@link AccessPath} is
 *         relation specific, but it could be relayered to provide support for
 *         the {@link BTree} backed solution sets.
