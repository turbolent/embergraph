/*
* Base class for operators which perform aggregation operations on binding sets.
 *
 * <h2>Aggregation semantics and errors.</h2>
 *
 * Per the DAWG:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   The result of an Aggregate which returns an error, is an error, but the SELECT expression
 *   result of projecting an error is unbound. (Hence, the variable is not projected for which the
 *   error occurred.)
 *   <li>An aggregation of an empty source solution set produces an empty output solution. <br>
 *       See http://www.openrdf.org/issues/browse/SES-884 (Aggregation with an solution set as input
 *       should produce an empty solution as output).
 *       <pre>
 * > In response to
 * > http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg-comments/2011Sep/0000.html
 * >
 * > > What is the output of this query if no solutions satisify the WHERE clause?
 * > > An empty solution set or a solution set with a single solution having
 * > > a binding of 0^^xsd:integer?
 * > >
 * > > PREFIX : <http://example/>
 * > > SELECT (SUM(?lprice) AS ?totalPrice)
 * > > WHERE {
