/**
 * A factory for named {@link ReadWriteLock}s. A simple {@link ReadWriteLock}
 * manages access to a single resource. However, a {@link NamedReadWriteLock}
 * manages access to the members of a set of named resources. This is more
 * efficient when the latency of the operation once the lock is acquired is
 * significant, e.g., an RMI call or a disk IO.
 * <p>
 * The locks are stored in a {@link WeakHashMap} so that they will be garbage
 * collected if there are no threads waiting in the queue for a given named
 * lock.
