/*
 * A service for sending raw {@link ByteBuffer}s across a socket. This service supports the HA write
 * pipeline. This service is designed to be paired with an {@link HAReceiveService}, which typically
 * is running on a different host. The {@link HASendService} provides only an efficient raw data
 * transfer. The HA write pipeline coordinates the transfer of data using RMI messages which tell
 * the receiver how much data to expect, the checksum of the data, etc.
 *
 * <h2>Implementation</h2>
 *
 * This class has a private single-threaded Executor to which it submits a {@link SendTask}. The
 * {@link SendTask} will open a blocking-mode {@link SocketChannel} to the service at the configured
 * {@link InetSocketAddress} and send the bytes remaining in a {@link ByteBuffer} to that service on
 * that {@link SocketChannel}. The data will be sent on the socket using {@link
 * WritableByteChannel#write(ByteBuffer)}, which is optimized for the NIO transfer of direct {@link
 * ByteBuffer}s. Since this is a blocking-mode connection, the write operation will block until all
 * bytes have been sent or the current thread is interrupted, e.g., by cancelling its Future.
 *
 * <p>The {@link SendTask} verifies that all bytes were sent as a post-condition (position() ==
 * limit). If there is any problem, then the {@link SocketChannel} is closed and the original
 * exception is thrown out of {@link SendTask#call()}. If the socket is closed from the other end
 * while we are still writing data, then that exception gets thrown out as well. The socket
 * connection is closed as a post-condition (it does not survive across multiple sends). Closing the
 * socket connection after each success or unsuccessful send gives us a strong indication of success
 * or failure for the data transfer which is independent of the RMI message and makes it trivial to
 * re-synchronize the {@link HASendService} since it is basically stateless.
 *
 * <p>Note: This class exposes its synchronization mechanism to {@link HAReceiveService}.
