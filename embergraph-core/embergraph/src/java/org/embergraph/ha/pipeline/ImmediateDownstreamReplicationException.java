/*
* An exception thrown by the {@link HAReceiveService} when replication to the downstream service
 * fails. The root cause can be an RMI error (can not connect or connection lost), a socket channel
 * write error (can not connect, connection lost, etc.), or even a transitive error from further
 * down the write pipeline. This exception DOES NOT decisively indicate the problem is with the
 * immediate downstream service. The caller must inspect the root cause to make this determination.
 * However, this exception DOES indicate that the problem is with downstream replication rather than
 * with the receipt or handling of the payload on this service.
