    /**
     * Instruct the service to move to the end of the write pipeline. The leader
     * MUST be the first service in the write pipeline since it is the service
     * to which the application directs all write requests. This message is used
     * when a leader will be elected and it needs to force other services before
     * it in the write pipeline to leave/add themselves from/to the write
     * pipeline such that the leader becomes the first service in the write
     * pipeline.
     * 
     * @todo It is possible for the leader to issue these messages in an
     *       sequence which is designed to arrange the write pipeline such that
     *       it has a good network topology. The leader must first analyze the
     *       network topology for the services in the pipeline, decide on a good
     *       order, and then issue the requests to the services in that order.
     *       Each service will move to the end of the pipeline in turn. Once all
     *       services have been moved to the end of the pipeline, the pipeline
     *       will reflect the desired total order. However, note that transient
     *       network partitioning, zookeeper session timeouts, etc. can all
     *       cause this order to be perturbed.
     * 
     * @todo A pipeline leave currently causes a service leave. Reconsider this
     *       because it would mean that reorganizing the pipeline would actually
     *       cause service leaves, which would temporarily break the quorum and
     *       certainly distribute the leader election. If we can do a pipeline
     *       leave without a service leave, if services which are joined always
     *       rejoin the write pipeline when the observe a pipeline leave, and if
     *       we can force a service leave (by instructing the service to
     *       bounce the zookeeper connection) if the service fails to
     *       rejoin the pipeline, then it would be easier to reorganize the
     *       pipeline. [This would still make it possible for services to add
     *       themselves to the pipeline without being joined with the quorum but
     *       the quorum watcher would now automatically add the service to the
     *       quorum before a join and add it back if it is removed from the
     *       pipeline while it was joined _if_ the quorum is not yet met (once
     *       the quorum is met we can not rejoin the pipeline if writes have
     *       propagated along the pipeline, and the pipeline is not clean at
     *       each commit - only when we have an exclusive lock on the
     *       {@link WriteExecutorService}).]
     * 
     * @todo The leader could also invoke this at any commit point where a
     *       service joins the quorum since we need to obtain an exclusive lock
     *       on the {@link WriteExecutorService} at that point (use as we do
     *       when we do a synchronous overflow).
     *       <p>
     *       Periodic re-optimizations should take into account that services
     *       which are bouncing should stay at the end of the pipeline even
     *       though they have higher network costs because loosing the service
     *       at the end of the pipeline causes minimal retransmission.
