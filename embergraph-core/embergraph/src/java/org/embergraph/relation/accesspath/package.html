<p>

    This package includes an abstraction layer for efficient access paths, including
    chunked iterators, blocking buffers, and an abstraction corresponding to the natural
    order of an index.  The main purpose of access paths is to support the evaluation
    of rules (aka JOINs or high-level query).
