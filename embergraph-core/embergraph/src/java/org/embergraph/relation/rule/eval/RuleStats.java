 * Statistics about what an {@link IStep} did when it was executed.
 *
 * <p>Program execution has the general form of either a set of {@link IStep}s executed, at least
 * logically, in parallel, or a sequence of {@link IStep}s executed in sequence. An {@link IStep}
 * may be a closure operation of one or more {@link IRule}s, even when it is the top-level {@link
 * IStep}. Inside of a closure operation, there are one or more rounds and each rule in the closure
 * will be run in each round. There is no implicit order on the rules within a closure operation,
 * but they may be forced to execute in a sequence if the total program execution context forces
 * sequential execution.
 *
 * <p>In order to aggregate the data on rule execution, we want to roll up the data for the
 * individual rules along the same lines as the program structure.
 *
 * @todo Report as counters aggregated by the {@link ILoadBalancerService}?
