<p>

    This package includes an abstraction layer for relations.  Each relation is backed
    by one or more indices - it essentially a logical container for those indices. (A
    relation can exist within a logical container as well). The relation is capable of
    selecting the most efficient index for query given a predicate that specifies a query
    constraint.  Mutable relations have insert and delete operations in addition to query.
