This module provides a scalable client / server architecture for graph data
management based on the principles of REST, Topic Maps, and RDF.  The client
architecture supports fast in-memory operations on graphs with scalable
incremental materialization.  The backend architecture maintains an object
cache in front of a SPARQL end point.  A custom integration provides cache
maintenance on update.  The architecture borrows from topic maps the concept
that anything may be a subject of discourse.  Thus, you can have statements
about statements (in a graph database this means that links are also vertices).
