/**
 * Assigns the term identifier to duplicate {@link BigdataValue} for a single
 * write operation when an {@link IDuplicateRemover} was applied.
 * 
 * @todo this should be more transparent. One way to do that is to get rid of
 *       {@link KVOList#map(org.embergraph.service.ndx.pipeline.KVOList.Op)} and
 *       {@link KVOList.Op} and provide a TERM2ID index write specific interface
 *       extending KVO. When the term identifier is assigned, we then invoke the
 *       method on that interface to set the term identifier on the original and
 *       any duplicates. The method would have to know about {@link KVOList}
 *       however, and that means that we would really need to different
 *       implementations depending on whether {@link KVOC} was being extended or
 *       not. This is possibly even more messy.
