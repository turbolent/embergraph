/**
 * Split handler enforces the constraint that a collision bucket is never split across a shard
 * boundary. This is a necessary constraint. If we were to permit the collision bucket to be split
 * across a shard boundary, then the scan for a matching entry in the BLOBS index will no longer be
 * shard local and therefore would no longer be ACID (that is, it will be busted). The constraint is
 * enforced by requiring the separator key to create a distinction in the prefix bytes which exclude
 * the collision counter.
