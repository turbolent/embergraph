/**
 * This class provides fast, efficient serialization for solution sets. Each
 * solution must be an {@link IBindingSet}s whose bound values are {@link IV}s
 * and their cached {@link EmbergraphValue}s. The {@link IV}s and the cached
 * {@link EmbergraphValue}s are efficiently and compactly represented in format
 * suitable for chunked messages or streaming. Decode is a fast online process.
 * Both encode and decode require the maintenance of a map from the {@link IV}
 * having cached {@link EmbergraphValue}s to those cached values.
 * 
 * <h2>Record Format</h2>
 * 
 * The format is as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * nbound
 * nvars
 * ncached 
 * (namespace)
 * var[0]...var[nvars-1]
 * bitmap-for-bound-variables
 * bitmap-for-IV-with-cached-Values
 * IV[0] ... IV[nbound-1]
 * Value[0] ... Value[ncached-1]
 * </pre>
 * 
 * where <code>nbound</code> is the #of bindings in the binding set. When zero,
 * the rest of the record is omitted.
 * <p>
 * where <code>nvars</code> is the #of new variables in this binding set. The
 * "schema" used to encode the bindings is based on the ordered set of variables
 * for which bindings are observed. The encoder writes this information out
 * incrementally. The decoder builds up this information as it decodes
 * solutions.
 * <p>
 * where <code>ncached</code> is the #of bindings in the binding set for which
 * there is a cached {@link EmbergraphValue} which has not already been written
 * into a previous record. Even if the {@link IV} has a cached
 * {@link EmbergraphValue}, if the {@link IV} has been previously written into a
 * record then the {@link IV} is NOT record in this record with a cached Value.
 * Further, if the {@link IV} appears more than once in a given record, the
 * cached value is only marked in the bitmap for the first such occurrence and
 * the cached value is only written into the record once.
 * <p>
 * where <code>namespace</code> is the namespace of the lexicon relation. This
 * is written out for the first solution having an {@link IVCache} association.
 * It is assumed that all {@link Value}s are {@link EmbergraphValue} for the same
 * lexicon relation. If no solutions have an {@link IVCache} association, then
 * the namespace will never be written into the encoded output.
 * <p>
 * where <code>var</code> is the name of a variable for which a binding was
 * first observed for the current solution. The names of the variables are
 * written in the order in which they are first observed. This forms the
 * implicit "schema" required to decode the {@link IV}[].
 * <p>
 * where <code>bitmap-for-bound-variables</code> is zero or more bytes providing
 * a bit map indicating those variables which are bound in this solution out of
 * the total set of variables which have been observed in the solutions
 * presented to this encode.
 * <p>
 * where <code>bitmap-for-IVs-with-cached-Values</code> is zero or more bytes
 * providing a bit map indicating which IVs are associated with cached values
 * written into the record. Whether or not an IV has a cached value must be
 * decided by the caller after processing the record and consulting an
 * (IV,Value) cache which they maintain over the set of records processed to
 * date. Cached values are written out (and the bit set) only the first time a
 * given IV with a cached Value is observed.
 * <p>
 * where <code>IV[n]</code> is an {@link IV} as encoded by {@link IVUtility}.
 * <p>
 * where {@link EmbergraphValue} is an RDF Value serialized using the
 * {@link EmbergraphValueSerializer} for the namespace of the lexicon.
 * 
 * <h2>Decode</h2>
 * 
 * The namespace of the lexicon is required in to obtain the
 * {@link EmbergraphValueFactory} and {@link EmbergraphValueSerializer} used to decode
 * and materialize the cached {@link EmbergraphValue}s. This information can be
 * sent before the records if it is not known to the caller.
 * <p>
 * The decoder materializes the cached values into a map (either a HashMap or
 * HTree, as appropriate for the data scale) as the records are processed. Only
 * one solution needs to be decoded at a time, but the decoder must maintain the
 * (IV,Value) cache across all decoded records. There is no need to indicate the
 * #of records, but IChunkMessage#getSolutionCount() in fact reports exactly
 * that information.
 * <p>
 * Each solution can be turned into an {@link IBindingSet} at the time that it
 * is decoded. If we use a standard {@link ListBindingSet}, then we need to
 * resolve each {@link IV} against the {@link IV} cache, setting its RDF Value
 * as a side effect before returning the IBindingSet to the caller. If we do a
 * custom {@link IBindingSet} implementation, then the cached
 * {@link EmbergraphValue} could be lazily materialized by hooking
 * {@link IVCache#getValue()}. Either way, the life cycle of the materialized
 * objects will be very short unless they are propagated into new solutions.
 * Short life cycle objects entail very little heap burden.
 * 
 * NOTE: the IVSolutionSetEncode may give us *DIFFERENT* representations for
 *       the same binding set, depending on its internal state. This is relevant
 *       insofar as we cannot perform safe equality checks over encoded values
 *       (the IVBindingSetEncoder provides this guarantee).

 *      TODO There chould be a completely different encoding when only a single
 *      variable is bound (column projection) especially if there are likely to
 *      be duplicate IVs. However, we still have to pass through the cached
 *      Value associations, which this does pretty efficiently.
