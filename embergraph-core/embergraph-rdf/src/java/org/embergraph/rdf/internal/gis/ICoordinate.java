/**
 * Interface for a coordinate (latitude, longitude) on a sphere. There are
 * several ways in which a coordinate may be expressed:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     Degrees, Minutes and Seconds
 *    
 *     DDD� MM' SS.S&quot;
 *     32� 18' 23.1&quot; N 122� 36' 52.5&quot; W
 *    
 *    
 *     Degrees and Decimal Minutes
 *    
 *     DDD� MM.MMM'
 *     32� 18.385' N 122� 36.875' W
 *     
 *    
 *     Decimal Degrees
 *    
 *     DDD.DDDDD�
 *     32.30642� N 122.61458� W
 *     or +32.30642, -122.61458
 *    
 *     These are the basics, but they can be listed many different ways.
 *    
 *     Here are a few examples:
 *    
 *     32� 18' 23.1&quot; N 122� 36' 52.5&quot; W
 *     
 *     32 18 23.1N 122 36 52.5 W
 *    
 *     32 18 23.1N/122 36 52.5W
 *    
 *     32:18:23N/122:36:52W
 *    
 *     321823N/1223652W (zeros would need to go in front of single digits and two zeros
 *     in front of the longitude degrees because it�s range is up to 180 � the latitude
 *     range is only up to 90)
 *    
 *     3218N/12236W
 * </pre>
