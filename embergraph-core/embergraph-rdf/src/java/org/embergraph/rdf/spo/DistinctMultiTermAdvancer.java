* This was cloned from the {@link DistinctTermAdvancer}. It supports an efficient scan of the
 * distinct term identifiers that appear in the first position(s) of the keys for the statement
 * index corresponding to the specified {@link IKeyOrder}. For example, using {@link
 * SPOKeyOrder#POS} will give you the term identifiers for the distinct predicates actually in use
 * within statements in the {@link SPORelation}.
 *
 * <p>Note: This class only offers additional functionality over the {@link DistinctTermAdvancer}
 * for a quad store. For example, consider a triple store with 2-bound on the {@link
 * SPOKeyOrder#SPO} index. Since you are only going to visit the distinct Object values, the
 * advancer will not "advance" over anything and you might as well use a normal {@link IAccessPath}
 * or rangeIterator.
