/**
 * <p>
 * A justification for a {@link StatementEnum#Inferred} statement. The head is
 * the entailed statement. The tail of the justification is one or more triple
 * pattern(s). Consider <code>rdf1</code>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *               (?u ?a ?y) -&gt; (?a rdf:type rdf:Property)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Then the triple pattern for the tail is:
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *           (0 ?a 0)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * where 0 reprents a {@link IRawTripleStore#NULL} term identifier.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * So a justification chain for <code>rdf1</code> would be:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *           head := [?a rdf:type rdf:Property]
 *           
 *           tail := [0 ?a 0]
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In fact, the total bindings for the rule are represented as a long[] with the
 * head occupying the 1st N positions in that array and the bindings for the
 * tail appearing thereafter in the declared order of the predicates in the
 * tail.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When a {@link StatementEnum#Explicit} statement is to be retracted from the
 * database we need to determined whether or not there exists a <strong>grounded</strong>
 * justification for that statement (same head). For each justification for that
 * statement we consider the tail. If there exists either an explicit statement
 * that satisifies the triple pattern for the tail or if there exists an
 * inference that satisifies the triple pattern for the tail and the inference
 * can be proven to be grounded by recursive examination of its justifications,
 * then the head is still valid and is converted from an explicit statement into
 * an inference.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This looks more or less like: <strong>Find all statements matching the
 * pattern. If any are explicit, then that part of the tail is grounded. If none
 * are explicit, then chase the justification recursively. Only retract a
 * justification when it can no longer be grounded.</strong>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The concept of grounded vs ungrounded justifications is described in <a
 * href="http://www.openrdf.org/doc/papers/inferencing.pdf"> Inferencing and
 * Truth Maintenance in RDF Schema : Exploring a naive practical approach</a>
 * by Jeen Broekstra and Arjohn Kampman.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @todo the tails could be represented more efficiently if we only stored the
 *       variable bindings and not all values in each tail. however, we might
 *       then need the rule on hand in order to decode the tail(s) and
 *       substitute in the missing constants.
