/*
 * A utility class for performing rule re-writes for RDF truth maintenance using a "focusStore" in
 * addition to the primary database. The focusStore is typically used in one of two ways: (1)
 * incremental loading of new data into the database; and (2) collecting entailments of statements
 * that are being removed during truth maintenance.
 *
 * <p>Note: When loading a new data set into the database, the "focusStore" should contain the
 * statements that were read from the data source, e.g., some RDF/XML file and the "buffer" should
 * be configured to write on the "database".
 *
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * @todo There are no unit tests for the magic predicate handling or handling of non-{@link
 *     SPORelation} {@link Predicate}s. The code tests on the {@link SPOPredicate} class, so it will
 *     break when generalizing to other relations. At some point, we should add a predicate "name"
 *     attribute, which is really the relation base name (without its container) and then test on
 *     the predicate name rather than its Class. The test in this class could then be written as
 *     pred.isInstance(relationBaseName) and the predicate interface could be constrained to only
 *     allow the predicate view to include relations sharing the same base name.

   * Truth maintenance for RDF needs to compute the entailments <i>as if</i> the statements in a
   * temporary triple store (known as the focusStore) were already part of the database (for insert)
   * or as if they had already been removed (for delete). Given a single rule with N predicates in
   * the tail, we generate N new rules that we will run <em>instead of</em> the original rule. For
   * each of those N new rules in turn, we set the relation for tail[i] to <i>focusStore</i>. When
   * the new rule is run, tail[i] will read from the [focusStore] rather than the original database.
   * All other predicates in the tail are modified to read from the fused view of the [database +
   * focusStore]. As a special case, when the rule has a single predicate in the tail, the predicate
   * is only run against the <i>focusStore</i> rather than <i>database</i> or the fused view
   * <i>[database + focusStore]. For all cases, the head of the rule is unchanged - this is the
   * relation on which the rules will write and it should always be the <i>database</i>.
   *
   * @param rule The original rule. The {@link IPredicate}s in this {@link Rule} should identify the
   *     {@link IRelation} for the database for which truth maintenance will be performed.
   * @param focusStore The temporary database containing the statements to be added to (or removed
   *     from) the database during truth maintenance.
   * @return An {@link IProgram} constructed as specified above. When they are executed, all of the
   *     resulting rules should write on the same buffer. This has the same effect as a UNION over
   *     the entailments of the individual rules.
