   * The revision time is <code>lastCommitTime+1</code>.
   *
   * <p>TODO The revision time for the entries in the history index is currently <code>
   * lastCommitTime+1</code>, but this needs to be thought through some more and various use cases
   * considered.
   *
   * <p>The issue with revision time is that we have to record things in the history index
   * incrementally, so it can not be a commit time because we do not have that yet. lastCommitTime+1
   * will always be strictly greater than the previous commit point. When you scan the history
   * index, you can then use fromKey=firstCommitTime to visit (or null for the head of the index).
   * toKey=firstCommitTime to be excluded (or null for the tail of the index). That all has
   * semantics that are pretty much what people would expect for the scan. However, the reported
   * revision times are not going to correspond directly to the commit points.
   *
   * <p>When reporting this data, we could resolve (and cache) the first commit time greater than
   * that commit point, but only if we still have access to that commit point (the resolution would
   * be against the commit record index, and commit points are pruned from that index when they are
   * recycled).
