/*
 * Methods for static analysis of a query. There is one method which looks "up". This corresponds to
 * how we actually evaluation things (left to right in the query plan). There are two methods which
 * look "down". This corresponds to the bottom-up evaluation semantics of SPARQL.
 *
 * <p>When determining the "known" bound variables on entry to a node we have to look "up" the tree
 * until we reach the outer most group. Note that named subqueries DO NOT receive bindings from the
 * places where they are INCLUDEd into the query.
 *
 * <h3>Analysis of Incoming "Known" Bound Variables (Looking Up)</h3>
 *
 * Static analysis of the incoming "known" bound variables does NOT reflect bottom up evaluation
 * semantics. If a variable binding would not be observed for bottom up evaluation semantics due to
 * a badly designed left join pattern then the AST MUST be rewritten to lift the badly designed left
 * join into a named subquery where it will enjoy effective bottom up evaluation semantics.
 *
 * <h3>Analysis of "must" and "maybe" Bound Variables (Looking Down).</h3>
 *
 * The following classes are producers of bindings and need to be handled by static analysis when
 * looking down the AST tree:
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>{@link QueryBase}
 *   <dd>The static analysis of the definitely and maybe bound variables depends on the projection
 *       and where clauses.
 *   <dt>{@link SubqueryRoot}
 *   <dd>SPARQL 1.1 subquery. This is just the static analysis of the QueryBase for that subquery.
 *   <dt>{@link NamedSubqueryRoot}
 *   <dd>This is just the static analysis of the QueryBase for that named subquery. Named subqueries
 *       are run without any visible bindings EXCEPT those which are exogenous.
 *   <dt>{@link NamedSubqueryInclude}
 *   <dd>The static analysis of the INCLUDE is really the static analysis of the NamedSubqueryRoot
 *       which produces that solution set. The incoming known variables are ignored when doing the
 *       static analysis of the named subquery root.
 *   <dt>{@link ServiceNode}
 *   <dd>The static analysis of the definitely and maybe bound variables depends on the graph
 *       pattern for that service call. This is analyzed like a normal graph pattern. Everything
 *       visible in the graph pattern is considered to be projected. As far as I can tell,
 *       ServiceNodes are not run "as-bound" and their static analysis is as if they were named
 *       subqueries (they have no known bound incoming variables other than those communicated by
 *       their BindingsClause).
 *   <dt>{@link StatementPatternNode}
 *   <dd>All variables are definitely bound UNLESS {@link StatementPatternNode#isOptional()} is
 *       <code>true</code>.
 *       <p>Note: we sometimes attach a simple optional join to the parent group for efficiency, at
 *       which point it becomes an "optional" statement pattern. An optional statement pattern may
 *       also have zero or more {@link FilterNode}s associated with it.
 *   <dt>{@link JoinGroupNode}
 *   <dd>
 *   <dt>{@link UnionNode}
 *   <dd>The definitely bound variables is the intersection of the definitely bound variables in the
 *       child join groups. The maybe bound variables is the union of the maybe bound variables in
 *       the child join groups.
 *   <dt>{@link AssignmentNode}
 *   <dd>BIND(expr AS var) in a group will not bind the variable if there is an error when
 *       evaluating the value expression and does not fail the solution. Thus BIND() in a group
 *       contributes to "maybe" bound variables.
 *       <p>Note: BIND() in a PROJECTION is handled differently as it is non-optional (if the value
 *       expression results in an error the solution is dropped). Projections are handled when we do
 *       the analysis of a QueryBase node since we can see both the WHERE clause and the PROJECTION
 *       clauses at the same time.
 *       <p>See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#assignment">If the evaluation of the
 *       expression produces an error, the variable remains unbound for that solution.</a>
 *   <dt><code>IF()</code>
 *   <dd>* <code>IF</code> semantics : If evaluating the first argument raises an error, then an
 *       error is raised for the evaluation of the IF expression. (This greatly simplifies the
 *       analysis of the EBV of the IF value expressions, but there is still uncertainty concerning
 *       whether the THEN or the ELSE is executed for a given solution.) However, <code>IF</code> is
 *       not allowed to conditionally bind a variable in the THEN/ELSE expressions so we do not have
 *       to consider it here.
 *   <dt><code>BOUND(var)</code>
 *   <dd>Filters which use BOUND() can not be pruned unless we can prove that the variable is not
 *       (or is not) bound and also collapse the filter to a constant after substituting either
 *       <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> in for the BOUND() expression.
 * </dl>
 *
 * <h3>FILTERs</h3>
 *
 * FILTERs are groups based on whether they can run before any required joins (pre-), with the
 * required join (join-), or after all joins (post-).
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>pre-
 *   <dd>The pre-filters have all their required variables bound on entry to the join group. They
 *       should be lifted into the parent join group.
 *   <dt>join-
 *   <dd>The join-filters will have all their required variables bound by the time the required
 *       joins are done. These filters will wind up attached to the appropriate required join. The
 *       specific filter/join attachments depend on the join evaluation order.
 *   <dt>post-
 *   <dd>The post-filters might not have all of their required variables bound. We have to wait
 *       until the last of the optionals joins has been evaluated before we can evaluate any
 *       post-filters, so they run "last".
 *   <dt>prune-
 *   <dd>The prune-filters are those whose required variables CAN NOT be bound. They should be
 *       pruned from the AST.
 * </dl>
 *
 * TODO We can probably cache the heck out of things on this class. There is no reason to recompute
 * the SA of the know or maybe/must bound variables until there is an AST change, and the caller can
 * build a new SA when that happens. However, note that we must make the cache sets unmodifiable
 * since there are a lot of patterns which rely on computing the difference between two sets and
 * those can not have a side-effect on the cache.
 *
 * <p>We could also attach the {@link StaticAnalysis} as an annotation on the {@link QueryRoot} and
 * provide a factory method for accessing it. That way we would have reuse of the cached static
 * analysis data. Each AST optimizer (or the {@link ASTOptimizerList}) would have to clear the
 * cached {@link StaticAnalysis} when producing a new {@link QueryRoot}. Do this when we add an
 * ASTContainer to provide a better home for the queryStr, the parse tree, the original AST, and the
 * optimized AST.

     * This case is the one explored in trac750, and the code

     * is tricky. A select expression that is an aggregate which evaluates
     * to an error will cause an unbound value for to be reported for the
     * projected variable for the solution in which the error is computed.
     * Therefore, we must not assume that aggregation expressions MUST be
     * bound. (Given the schema flexible nature of RDF data, it is very
     * difficult to prove that an aggregate expression will never result in
     * an error without actually running the aggregation query.)
