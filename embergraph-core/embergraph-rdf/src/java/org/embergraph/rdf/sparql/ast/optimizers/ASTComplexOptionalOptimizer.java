/**
 * NOTE: this optimizer was not sound from a correctness perspective in previous
 * versions (cf. http://trac.blazegraph.com/ticket/1071); the rewritten form should 
 * be fine from a correctness perspective, but does not really optimize queries
 * from a performance perspective, so it has been (temporarily) disabled in the
 * {@link DefaultOptimizerList}. The description below describes the original
 * idea, the actual implementation slightly differs in (i) that it passes around
 * intermediate solutions (rather than computing all joins over the original
 * outer mapping set) and (ii) does not compute a final join over all
 * intermediate solutions but simply returns the last computed result (which
 * is now possible due to (i)). 
 * 
 * Also note that the {@link AST2BOpUtility} has been refactored (as part of
 * ticket #1071 and #1118) and now implements intelligent pushing of projection
 * variables into OPTIONAL blocks, so there's probably no more need for this
 * optimizer.
 * 
 * 
 * Rewrite a join group using two or more complex OPTIONAL groups using a hash
 * join pattern.
 * <p>
 * Note: this optimization is not required if there is only one complex optional
 * in the join group. It is only when there are multiple complex optional groups
 * that we need to lift those groups out as named subqueries (since they need to
 * feed each other). If there is only one complex optional group, then we can
 * run it as a sub-group instead.
 * <p>
 * NOte: This optimization presumes that simple optional groups were already
 * translated into optional {@link StatementPatternNode}s.
 * <p>
 * Queries with multiple complex optional groups can be rewritten into the hash
 * join of solution sets as follows.
 * 
 * <ol>
 * 
 * <li>First, create a hash index from the required joins and any simple
 * optional joins. Given the modeling abilities of the AST, this is most easily
 * achieved by converting the required joins into a named subquery. The join
 * variable(s) for that named subquery will the subset of variable(s) which are
 * shared by each of the complex OPTIONAL groups. The
 * {@link ASTNamedSubqueryOptimizer} already handles the assignment of join
 * variables, so we do not need to consider it further here.</li>
 * 
 * <li>For each complex optional group, use the solution step generated in (1)
 * and run the optional group as a named subquery producing a new solution set.
 * The WHERE clause of the named subquery should look like:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {INCLUDE %set . OPTIONAL {...}}
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li>Join all of the named solution sets in (2) back together. For example, if
 * there were two complex optional groups and the required joins resulted in
 * known bound variables for var1 and var2, then those result sets might be
 * combined as follows in the main WHERE clause of the rewritten query.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * INCLUDE %set1 .
 * INCLUDE %set2 JOIN ON (?var1, ?var2) .
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Note: The join variables for those INCLUDEs MUST be identified through static
 * analysis. Failure to use available join variables will result in an extremely
 * inefficient query plan as the full cross product of the solutions will be
 * compared to identify solutions which join.</li>
 * 
 * </ol>
 * 
 * TODO The rewrite into named subquery includes means that we wind up building
 * more hash indices than we strictly require as a hash index will also be built
 * at the start of each optional group. However, since the hash index at the
 * start of the optional group has exactly the same data as the named subquery
 * include's hash index, we should elide the step which builds the extra hash
 * index.
 * 
 * TODO This optimzer should not be strictly necessary at all. The same behavior
 * should arise from running the complex optionals as sub-groups. Based on a few
 * govtrack CI queries, it looks like we do better when the complex optional
 * groups are lifted out as named subqueries. We need to go back and investigate
 * whether or not this is true and why.
