/**
 * Handles a variety of special constructions related to graph graph groups.
 * 
 * <dl>
 * <dt>GRAPH ?foo</dt>
 * <dd>
 * Anything nested (even if a subquery) is constrained to be from
 * <code>?foo</code>. All nested statement patterns must have <code>?foo</code>
 * as their context, even if they occur within a subquery. (This is not true for
 * a named subquery which just projects its solutions but does not inherit the
 * parent's graph context. However, if we lifted the named subquery out, e.g.,
 * for bottom up evaluation semantics, then we need to impose the GRAPH
 * constraint on the named subquery which means running this optimizer before
 * the one which lifts out the named subquery.)</dd>
 * <dt>GRAPH ?foo { GRAPH ?bar } }</dt>
 * <dd>The easy way to enforce this constraint when there are nested graph
 * patterns is with a <code>SameTerm(?foo,?bar)</code> constraint inside of the
 * nested graph pattern.
 * <p>
 * The problem with this is that it does not enforce the constraint as soon as
 * possible under some conditions. A rewrite of the variable would have that
 * effect but the rewrite needs to be aware of variable scope rules so we do not
 * rewrite the variable within a subquery if it is not projected by that
 * subquery. We would also have to add a BIND(?foo AS ?bar) to make ?bar visible
 * in the scope of parent groups.
 * <p>
 * However, there is an INCLUDE problem too. That could be handled by moving the
 * INCLUDE into a subgroup with a BIND to renamed the variable or by adding a
 * "projection" to the INCLUDE so we could rename the variable there.
 * <p>
 * Since this construction of nested graph patterns is rare, and since it is
 * complicated to make it more efficient, we are going with the SameTerm()
 * constraint for now.</dd>
 * <dt>GRAPH uri</dt>
 * <dd>
 * This is only allowed if the uri is in the named data set (or if no data set
 * was given). Translation time error.</dd>
 * <dt>GRAPH uri { ... GRAPH uri2 ... }</dt>
 * <dd>It is an query error if a <code>GRAPH uri</code> is nested within another
 * <code>GRAPH uri</code> for distinct IRIs.</dd>
 * <dt>GRAPH uri { ... GRAPH ?foo ... }</dt>
 * <dd>The outer graph imposes a constant constraint. The inner graph needs to
 * inherit that constraint. Either a SameTerm() constraint must be added to the
 * inner graph or context for the inner graph could be rewritten using
 * Constant/2. Again, this is an optimization which may not contribute much
 * value except in very rare cases. Unlike the case below, we do need to impose
 * a SameTerm() constraint to make this case correct.</dd>
 * <dt>GRAPH ?foo { ... GRAPH uri ... }</dt>
 * <dd>If a constant is nested within a <i>non-optional</i>
 * <code>GRAPH uri</code> then that constant could be lifted up and bound using
 * Constant/2 on the outer graph pattern. Again, this is an optimization which
 * may not contribute much value except in very rare cases. We do not need to do
 * anything additional to make this case correct.</dd>
 * <dt>GRAPH ?g {}</dt>
 * <dd>This matches the distinct named graphs in the named graph portion of the
 * data set (special case). There are several variations on this which need to
 * be handled:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If ?g might be bound or is not bound:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If there is no data set, then this should be translated into
 * sp(_,_,_,?g)[filter=distinct] that should be recognized and evaluated using a
 * distinct term advancer on CSPO.</li>
 * <li>If the named graphs are explicitly given, then annotate
 * {@link StatementPatternNode} with an "IN" for <code>(?g,namedGraphs)</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Either way, if there is a filter then apply the filter to the scan/list (this
 * happens in AST2BOPUtility#toPredicate()).</li>
 * <li>If <code>?g</code> is known bound coming into <code>graph ?g {}</code>
 * then we want to test for the existence of at least one statement on the CSPO
 * index for <code>?g</code>.This is basically ASK sp(_,_,_,uri) LIMIT 1, but we
 * must run this for each binding on <code>?g</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </dd>
 * <dt>GRAPH uri {}</dt>
 * <dd>This is an existence test for the graph. This is a CSPO iterator with C
 * bound and a limit of one. Lift this into a named subquery since we only want
 * to run it once. (This is basically ASK sp(_,_,_,uri) LIMIT 1.)</dd>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * Note: This optimizer MUST run before optimizers which lift out named
 * subqueries in order to correctly impose the GRAPH constraints on the named
 * subquery.
 * 
 * @see ASTEmptyGroupOptimizer, which handles <code>{}</code> for non-GRAPH
 *      groups.

 *          TODO If <code>?g</code> can be statically analyzed as being bound to
 *          a specific constant then we would rewrite <code>?g</code> using
 *          Constant/2 and then handle this as <code>GRAPH uri {}</code>
 *          <p>
 *          This is basically what {@link AST2BOpJoins} does when it follows the
 *          decision tree for named and default graphs. So, maybe that logic can
 *          be lifted into this class as a rewrite?
