 * This is identical to the {@link BufferChunkCapacityHint}, but it is accessed through the well
 * known name {@link QueryHints#CHUNK_SIZE}.
 *
 * <p>Sets the capacity of the output buffer that used to accumulate chunks of solutions (default
 * {@value BufferAnnotations#DEFAULT_CHUNK_CAPACITY}). Partial chunks may be automatically combined
 * into full chunks.
 *
 * <p>Note: The "chunkSize" is a general property of the query engine. This query hint does not
 * change the structure of the query plan, but simply serves as a directive to the query engine that
 * it should allocate an output buffer for the operator that will emit chunks of the indicated
 * target capacity. This query hint is allowed in any scope, but is generally used to effect the
 * behavior of a join group, a subquery, or the entire query. The hint is transferred as an
 * annotation onto all query plan operators generated from the annotated scope.
