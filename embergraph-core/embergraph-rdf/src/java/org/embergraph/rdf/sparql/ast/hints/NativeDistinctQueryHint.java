/**
 * Query hint for turning the {@link HTreeDistinctBindingSetsOp} on/off.
 * 
 * TODO This can only be used enable/disable the native distinct solutions both
 * on a query wide basis (via {@link AST2BOpContext}). However, it should be
 * possible to enable/disable this on a (sub-)select basis (by interpreting the
 * AST annotation when we are generating the query plan. When supporting this
 * more selective application, write a unit test which verifies that the native
 * distinct annotation is correctly interpreted when it appears on a
 * {@link QueryBase}.
 * 
 * TODO The same is true of {@link QueryHints#NATIVE_DISTINCT_SPO} and several
 * other similar "analytic" hints. However, this is not possible (or is more
 * difficult) when the native versus JVM semantics of the operation span
 * non-local operators (i.e., named subqueries with their non-local includes).
