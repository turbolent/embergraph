     * there is no a-priori reason why we should run pipelined subqueries

     *
     * Also, note that named subquery includes are hash joins. We have an
     * index. If the operator supported cutoff evaluation then we could
     * easily reorder them with the other required joins using the RTO.
     *
     * Ditto for pipelined SPARQL 1.1 subquery. If it supported cutoff
     * evaluation, then the RTO could reorder them with the required joins.
     * This is even true when the subquery uses GROUP BY or ORDER BY, which
     * imply the use of at once operators. While we must fully materialize
     * the solutions for each evaluation of the subquery, the evaluation is
     * based on the as-bound solutions flowing into the subquery. If the
     * subquery is unselective, then clearly this will be painful and it
     * might be better to lift such unselective subqueries into named
     * subqueries in order to obtain a hash index over the entire subquery
     * solution set when evaluated with an empty source binding set.
     *
     * Note: This logic was originally constructed before we had required
     * joins other than on a statement pattern. This shaped how the FILTERs
     * were attached and how the materialization pipeline was generated in
     * order to have materialized RDF Values on hand for those FILTERs.
     *
     * We now have several kinds of required joins: pipelined statement
     * pattern joins, SPARQL 1.1 subquery, named subquery include, subquery
     * hash joins (when the subquery is optional), service call joins, etc.
     *
     * FIXME The code currently only handles the FILTER attachment and
     * materialization pipeline for the required statement pattern joins.
     * However, for efficiency, FILTERs MUST be attached to these joins as
     * appropriate for ALL CASES and variables MUST be materialized as
     * required for those filters to run.
     *
     * FIXME All of these joins can be reordered by either static analysis
     * of cardinality (which has not been extended to handle this yet) or by
     * the RTO. The filter attachment decisions (and the materialization
     * pipeline generation) needs to be deferred until we actually evaluate
     * the join graph (at least for the RTO).
