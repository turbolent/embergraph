   * Specifically, given a particular node (the starting node) in a particular
   * RDF graph (the source graph), a subgraph of that particular graph, taken
   * to comprise a symmetric concise bounded description of the resource
   * denoted by the starting node, can be identified as follows:
   *
   * 1. Include in the subgraph all statements in the source graph where the
   * object of the statement is the starting node;
   *
   * 2. Recursively, for all statements identified in the subgraph thus far
   * having a blank node subject not equal to the starting node, include in
   * the subgraph all statements in the source graph where the object of the
   * statement is the blank node in question and which are not already
   * included in the subgraph.
   *
   * 3. Recursively, for all statements included in the subgraph thus far, for
   * all reifications of each statement in the source graph, include the
   * symmetric concise bounded description beginning from the rdf:Statement
   * node of each reification.
   *
   * 4. Include in the subgraph the concise bounded description beginning from
   * the starting node.
   *
   * This produces a subgraph that includes a concise bounded description,
   * given the same starting point, but in addition, includes all inbound arc
   * paths, up to but not beyond a URIref subject node.
   * </pre>
   *
   * Note: Our evaluation actually proceeds in both the forward and reverse direction at the same
   * time. However, this is an efficiency matter and has no effect on the semantics of the
   * description.
