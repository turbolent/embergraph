 * Extends {@link KVOList} to provide handshaking with a {@link KVOLatch}.

 * duplicates so that the {@link KVOLatch} of each duplicate as well as the
 * original are decremented after a successful write. Failure to do this will
 * cause a {@link KVOLatch#dec()} to be "lost" and generally results in
 * non-termination of {@link KVOLatch#await()} since the count for the "lost"
 * latch would never reach zero.
