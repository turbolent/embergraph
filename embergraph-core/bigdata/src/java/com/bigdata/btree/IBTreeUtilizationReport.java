/**
 * B+Tree utilization report.
 * <p>
 * Note: The utilization numbers reported by this interface are a bit
 * misleading. They only consider the #of index positions in the node or leaf
 * which is full, but do not take into account the manner in which the
 * persistence store allocates space to the node or leaf. For example, for the
 * WORM we do perfect allocations but retain many versions. For the RWStore, we
 * do best-fit allocations but recycle old versions. The space efficiency of the
 * persistence store is typically the main driver, not the utilization rate as
 * reported here.
