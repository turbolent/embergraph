/**
 * A stream of {@link IBindingSet} are mapped across the shards which will have
 * the data for the {@link IPredicate#asBound(IBindingSet)} {@link IPredicate}.
 * <p>
 * Unsynchronized (non-thread safe) buffer maps the {@link IBindingSet}s across
 * the index partition(s) associated with an {@link IPredicate} and
 * {@link IKeyOrder}. For each source chunk, "as bound" versions of the target
 * {@link IPredicate} are constructed and the {@link IBindingSet}s in the chunk
 * are reordered based on {@link IKeyOrder#getFromKey(IKeyBuilder, IPredicate)}
 * for each asBound predicate. The {@link PartitionLocator}s are discovered for
 * each fromKey using an ordered locator scan and the binding sets are output
 * onto a shard or node specific {@link IBuffer} created by a concrete subclass.
 * The subclass is responsible for getting the binding sets from this node onto
 * the node associated with each output buffer.

 *            The generic type of the elements in the buffer.
 * @param <F>
 *            The generic type of the elements in the relation associated with
 *            the {@link IPredicate}.
 * 
 * @todo This could be refactored such that it no longer implemented
 *       {@link IBuffer} but instead was a {@link BOp} with binding sets
 *       streaming in from its source. However, unlike a normal {@link BOp} it
 *       would have a compound sink and it would have to be tightly integrated
 *       with the {@link QueryEngine} to be used.
 *       <p>
 *       In fact, this is pretty much just doing a join against the metadata
 *       index. However, it presumes that there are far fewer index partitions
 *       than tuples flowing through the system and that it is better to read
 *       remotely from the {@link IMetadataIndex} and cache than ro use the
 *       general purpose pipeline join, which would cause all binding sets to be
 *       routed through the centralized {@link IMetadataIndex}.
