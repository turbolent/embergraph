 *          TODO Large samples should be buffered on the {@link IMemoryManager}
 *          so they do not pose a burden on the heap. This will require us to
 *          manage the allocation contexts so we can release samples in a timely
 *          manner once they are no longer used and always release samples by
 *          the time the RTO is finished. [There is an additional twist if we
 *          have fully materialized some part of the join since we no longer
 *          need to evaluate that path segment. If the RTO can interleave query
 *          evaluation with exploration then we can take advantage of these
 *          materialized solutions.]
