/**
 * Class accepts a join group and partitions it into a join graph and a tail
 * plan.
 * <p>
 * A join group consists of an ordered collection of {@link IPredicate}s and an
 * unordered collection of {@link IConstraint}s. {@link IPredicate} representing
 * non-optional joins are extracted into a {@link JoinGraph} along with any
 * {@link IConstraint}s whose variables are guaranteed to be bound by the
 * implied joins.
 * <p>
 * The remainder of the {@link IPredicate}s and {@link IConstraint}s form a
 * "tail plan". {@link IConstraint}s in the tail plan are attached to the last
 * {@link IPredicate} at which their variable(s) MIGHT have become bound.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * 
 * @todo Things like LET can also bind variables. So can a subquery. Analysis of
 *       those will tell us whether the variable will definitely or
 *       conditionally become bound (I am assuming that a LET can conditionally
 *       leave a variable unbound). See {@link Bind}.
 * 
 * @todo runFirst flag on the expander (for free text search). this should be an
 *       annotation. this can be a [headPlan]. [There can be constraints which
 *       are evaluated against the head plan. They need to get attached to the
 *       joins generated for the head plan. MikeP writes: There is a free text
 *       search access path that replaces the actual access path for the
 *       predicate, which is meaningless in an of itself because the P is
 *       magical.]
 * 
 * @deprecated by {@link StaticAnalysis_CanJoin} which is a port of this code to
 *             the AST mode.

     * constraints may be run. Unlike the case when the variable is directly
     * shared between the two predicates, a join involving a constraint requires

     * constraint may be attached.
     * <p>
     * Note: Use {@link PartitionedJoinGroup#canJoin(IPredicate, IPredicate)}
     * instead to identify joins based on a variable which is directly shared.

     * variables. However, such joins will produce the full cross product of the

//	 *         when this is a subquery, the caller has to declare which
//	 *         variables are selected and will be returned out of the subquery).
//	 * 
//	 *         FIXME For scale-out, we need to either mark the join's evaluation
//	 *         context based on whether or not the access path is local or
//	 *         remote (and whether the index is key-range distributed or hash
//	 *         partitioned).
//	 * 
//	 *         FIXME Add a method to generate a runnable query plan from the
//	 *         collection of predicates and constraints on the
//	 *         {@link PartitionedJoinGroup} together with an ordering over the
//	 *         join graph. This is a bit different for the join graph and the
//	 *         optionals in the tail plan. The join graph itself should either
//	 *         be a {@link JoinGraph} operator which gets evaluated at run time
//	 *         or reordered by whichever optimizer is selected for the query
//	 *         (query hints).
//	 * 
//	 * @todo The order of the {@link IPredicate}s in the tail plan is currently
//	 *       unchanged from their given order (optional joins without
//	 *       constraints can not reduce the selectivity of the query). However,
//	 *       it could be worthwhile to run optionals with constraints before
//	 *       those without constraints since the constraints can reduce the
//	 *       selectivity of the query. If we do this, then we need to reorder
//	 *       the optionals based on the partial order imposed what variables
//	 *       they MIGHT bind (which are not bound by the join graph).
//	 * 
//	 * @todo multiple runFirst predicates can be evaluated in parallel unless
//	 *       they have shared variables. When there are no shared variables,
//	 *       construct a TEE pattern such that evaluation proceeds in parallel.
//	 *       When there are shared variables, the runFirst predicates must be
//	 *       ordered based on those shared variables (at which point, it is
