<p>

	This package provides a scale-out content repository (aka distributed file
	system) suitable as the backend for a REST-ful service using the bigdata
	architecture.  Content is arbitrary byte[]s broken down into chunks of up to
	64M each.  Basic and extensible metadata may be stored for any given item of
	content.  Atomic operations on chunks are provided for reading, writing,
	deleting, etc.  The architecture is designed for interoperation with map /
	reduce style processing.
