This package extends {@link com.bigdata.quorum} to define local and
{@link java.net.Remote} interfaces for highly available services.  Those
interfaces provide for write replication, low-level reads on quorum members,
a 2-phase quorum commit protocol, synchronization of the persistent state of
services which need to join a quorum, etc.
