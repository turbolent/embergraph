 * Abstract base class for {@link IBigdataFederation} implementations where the
 * services are distributed using RMI and are running, at least in principle,
 * across more than one host/JVM.
 * 
 * @todo Explore a variety of cached and uncached strategies for the metadata
 *       index. An uncached strategy is currently used. However, caching may be
 *       necessary for some kinds of application profiles, especially as the #of
 *       index partitions grows. If an application performs only unisolated and
 *       read-committed operations, then a single metadata index cache can be
 *       shared by the client for all operations against a given scale-out
 *       index. On the other hand, a client that uses transactions or performs
 *       historical reads will need to have a view of the metadata index as of
 *       the timestamp associated with the transaction or historical read.
 * 
 * @todo support failover metadata service discovery.
 *
