/**
 * Interface for finding the {@link Split}s for an ordered set of unsigned
 * byte[] keys. Each key MUST be fully specified, e.g., point lookup. This
 * algorithm does NOT handle cases where multiple partitions must be scanned
 * because they share the same prefix as the key.
 * <p>
 * The splitter processes the keys in order. It queries the
 * {@link IMetadataIndex} for the partition spanning the first key. It then
 * places all keys spanned by that partition into that split. When it reaches
 * the first key which is GTE the rightSeparator, it queries the MDI for that
 * key. Index partition Split, Move and Joins should not be able to cause a
 * problem for this algorithm. At the worst, some tuples will be directed to a
 * stale locator and the stale locator exception is handled.
 * <p>
 * The split operation is not atomic, however it is consistent in the following
 * sense. Any identified {@link Split}s will either be for a valid index
 * partition, for a partition of an index which has been deleted, or for an
 * index partition which has since been split, joined or moved. In the latter
 * case a {@link StaleLocatorException} will be thrown if the client attempts an
 * operation on the unisolated view of that index partition. All clients know
 * how to handle that exception and redirect the request as appropriate.
