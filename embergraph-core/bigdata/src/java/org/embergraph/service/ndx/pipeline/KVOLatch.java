/**
 * A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to await asynchronous
 * writes on one or more scale-out indices. Once the counter reaches zero, all
 * waiting threads are released. The counter is decremented automatically once a
 * {@link KVOC} has been successfully written onto an index by an asynchronous
 * write operation. This class may also be used as a synchronization aid
 * independent of a {@link KVOC}
 * <p>
 * Since it is possible that the counter could be transiently zero as chunks are
 * being added and drained concurrently, you MUST {@link #inc() increment} the
 * counter before adding the first chunk and {@link #dec() decrement} the
 * counter after adding the last chunk. Threads may invoke {@link #await()} any
 * time after the counter has been incremented. They will not be released until
 * the counter is zero. If you have protected against transient zeros by
 * pre-incrementing the counter, the threads will not be released until the
 * asynchronous write operations are successfully completed.
 * <p>
 * The notification is based on {@link KVOC}, which associates an atomic counter
 * and a user-defined key with each tuple. Notices are generated when the atomic
 * counter is zero on decrement. Notices are aligned with the appropriate scope
 * by creating an instance of the {@link KVOScope} with that scope and then
 * pairing it with each {@link KVOC}.
