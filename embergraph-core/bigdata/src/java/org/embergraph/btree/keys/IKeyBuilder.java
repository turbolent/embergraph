/**
 * <p>
 * Interface for building up variable <code>unsigned byte[]</code> keys from
 * one or more primitive data types values and/or Unicode strings. An instance
 * of this interface may be {@link #reset()} and reused to encode a series of
 * keys.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A sort key is an unsigned byte[] that preserves the total order of the
 * original data. Sort keys may potentially be formed from multiple fields but
 * field markers do not appear within the resulting sort key. While the original
 * values can be extracted from sort keys (this is true of all the fixed length
 * fields, such as int, long, float, or double) they can not be extracted from
 * Unicode variable length fields (the collation ordering for a Unicode string
 * depends on the {@link Locale}, the collation strength, and the decomposition
 * mode and is a non-reversable operation).
 * </p>
 * <h2>Unicode</h2>
 * <p>
 * Factory methods are defined by {@link KeyBuilder} for obtaining instances of
 * this interface that optionally support Unicode. Instances may be created for
 * a given {@link Locale}, collation strength, decomposition mode, etc.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The ICU library supports generation of compressed Unicode sort keys and is
 * used by default when available. The JDK {@link java.text} package also
 * supports the generation of Unicode sort keys, but it does NOT produce
 * compressed sort keys. The resulting sort keys are therefore (a) incompatible
 * with those produced by the ICU library and (b) much larger than those
 * produced by the ICU library.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Support for Unicode MAY be disabled using {@link Options#COLLATOR}, by using
 * {@link KeyBuilder#newInstance()} or another factory method that does not
 * enable Unicode support, or by using one of the {@link KeyBuilder}
 * constructors that does not support Unicode.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Multi-field keys with variable length fields</h2>
 * <p>
 * Multi-field keys in which variable length fields are embedded within the key
 * present a special problem. Any run of fixed length fields can be compared as
 * unsigned byte[]s. Likewise, any any key with a fixed length prefix (including
 * zero) but a variable length field in its tail can also be compared directly
 * as unsigned byte[]s. However, the introduction of a variable length field
 * into any non-terminal position in a multi-field key must be handled specially
 * since simple concatenation of the field keys will NOT produce the correct
 * total ordering. (This is why SQL requires that text fields compare as if they
 * were padded out with ASCII blanks (0x20) to some maximum length for the
 * field.) A utility method exists specifically for this purpose - see
 * {@link #appendText(String, boolean, boolean)}.

     * <p>
     * Note: Trailing pad characters are normalized to a representation as a
     * single pad character (1 byte) followed by the #of actual or implied
     * trailing pad characters represented as an unsigned short integer (2
     * bytes). This technique serves to keep multi-field keys with embedded
     * variable length text fields aligned such that the field following a
     * variable length text field does not bleed into the lexiographic ordering
     * of the variable length text field.
     * <p>
     * Note: While the ASCII encoding happens to use one byte for each character
     * that is NOT true of the Unicode encoding. The space requirements for the

     * <p>
     * Note: The <i>successor</i> option is designed to encapsulate some
     * trickiness around forming the successor of a variable length text field

     * that the resulting "successor" is actually ordered before the original
     * key. This happens because you introduce a 0x0 byte right on the boundary
     * of the next field, effectively causing the next field to have a smaller
     * value. Consider the following example (in hex) where "|" represents the

     * 
     * <pre>
     *     ab cd | 12

     * 
     * if you compute the successor by appending a nul byte to the text field

     * 
     * <pre>
     *     ab cd | 00 12
     * </pre>
