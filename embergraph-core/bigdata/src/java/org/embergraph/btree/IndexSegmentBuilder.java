/**
 * Builds an {@link IndexSegment} given a source btree and a target branching
 * factor. There are two main use cases:
 * <ol>
 * 
 * <li>Evicting a key range of an index into an optimized on-disk index. In this
 * case, the input is a {@link BTree} that is ideally backed by a fully buffered
 * {@link IRawStore} so that no random reads are required.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Merging index segments. In this case, the input is typically records
 * emerging from a merge-sort. There are two distinct cases here. In one, we
 * simply have raw records that are being merged into an index. This might occur
 * when merging two key ranges or when external data are being loaded. In the
 * other case we are processing two time-stamped versions of an overlapping key
 * range. In this case, the more recent version may have "delete" markers
 * indicating that a key present in an older version has been deleted in the
 * newer version. Also, key-value entries in the newer version replaced (rather
 * than are merged with) key-value entries in the older version. If an entry
 * history policy is defined, then it must be applied here to cause key-value
 * whose retention is no longer required by that policy to be dropped.</li>
 * 
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <h3>One pass vs. Two Pass Design Alternatives</h3>
 * 
 * There are at least three design alternatives for index segment builds: (A) do
 * an exact range count instead and generate a perfect plan; (B) fully buffer
 * the source iterator into byte[][] keys, byte[][] vals, boolean[]
 * deleteMarkers, and long[] versionTimestamps and generate an exact plan,
 * consuming the buffered byte[]s directly from RAM; and (C) use the fast range
 * count to generate a plan based on an overestimate of the tuple count and then
 * apply a variety of hacks when the source iterator is exhausted to make the
 * output B+Tree usable, but not well formed.
 * <p>
 * The disadvantage of (A) is that it requires two passes over the source view,
 * which substantially increases the run time of the algorithm. In addition, the
 * passes can drive evictions in the global LRU and could defeat caching for a
 * view approaching the nominal size for a split. However, with (A) we can do
 * builds for very large source B+Trees. Therefore, (A) is implemented for such
 * use cases.
 * <p>
 * The disadvantage of (B) is that it requires more memory. However, it is much
 * faster than (A). To compensate for the increased memory demand, we can single
 * thread builds, merges, and splits and fall back to (A) if memory is very
 * tight or the source view is very large.
 * <p>
 * The disadvantage of (C) is that the "hacks" break encapsulation and leak into
 * the API where operations such as retrieving the right sibling of a node could
 * return an empty leaf (since we ran out of tuples for the plan). Since these
 * "hacks" would break encapsulation, it would be difficult to have confidence
 * that the B+Tree API was fully insulated against the effects of ill-formed
 * {@link IndexSegment}s. Therefore, I have discarded this approach and backed
 * out changes designed to support it from the code base.
 * 
 * <h3>Design alternatives for totally ordered nodes and leaves</h3>
 * 
 * In order for the nodes to be written in a contiguous block we either have to
 * buffer them in memory or have to write them onto a temporary file and then
 * copy them into place after the last leaf has been processed. This concern was
 * not present in West's algorithm because it did not attempt to place the nodes
 * and/or leaves contiguously onto the generated B+Tree file.
 * <p>
 * For the two pass design described above as option (A), the code buffers the
 * nodes and leaves onto {@link TemporaryRawStore}s. This approach is scalable,
 * which is the concern of (A), but requires at least twice the IO when compared
 * to directly writing the nodes and leaves onto the output file.
 * <p>
 * When sufficient memory is available, as cases where (B) would apply, we can
 * write the leaves directly on the backing file (using double-buffering to
 * update the prior/next addrs). Since there are far fewer nodes than leaves, we
 * can buffer the nodes in memory, writing them once the leaves are finished.

 * @see "Post-order B-Tree Construction" by Lawerence West, ACM 1992. Note that
 *      West's algorithm is for a b-tree (values are stored on internal stack as
 *      well as leaves), not a b+-tree (values are stored only on the leaves).
 *      Our implementation is therefore an adaptation.
 * 
 * @see "Batch-Construction of B+-Trees" by Kim and Won, ACM 2001. The approach
 *      outlined by Kim and Won is designed for B+-Trees, but it appears to be
 *      less efficient on first glance.
 * 
 * @see IndexSegment
 * @see IndexSegmentFile
 * @see IndexSegmentCheckpoint
 * 
 * @todo Put profiler on (B) for build stress tests. The source view should be
 *       pre-generated such that we only measure the build behavior in the
 *       profiler. See {@link TestIndexSegmentBuilderWithLargeTrees}. [We need
 *       to first remove the synchronization for disk reads on the journal so we
 *       have the maximum possible IO rate, and possibly materialize the leaves
 *       of the source view in parallel using pre-fetch.]
 *       <p>
 *       Make sure that {@link #elapsed} reports the total build time, including
 *       the range count or pre-materialization costs as those are a significant
 *       part of the total cost.
 *       <p>
 *       Much of the cost of the build is the range iterator, including decoding
 *       the nodes and leaves and materializing tuples. Most of the remaining
 *       cost is the coding of the new nodes and leaves and their IO. Some of
 *       that cost can be trimmed by faster coders, but we can also trim the IO
 *       using parallel materialization of leaves (for {@link IndexSegment}) and
 *       pre-fetch of nodes and leaves (for {@link BTree}s).
 *       <p>
 *       The B+Tree iterator on the fused view of the journal and index segments
 *       is effectively an incremental merge of the source iterators. However,
 *       the iterator has a [capacity] parameter which is a hint for
 *       materialization. We could do this as a parallel merge sort of the
 *       leaves spanned of the key range with a restriction for the capacity.
 *       That could also be done on a GPU. The same iterator is used as the
 *       source for a compacting merge. If we tunnel the representation to
 *       something like the byte[][] keys, byte[][] vals, boolean[]
 *       deleteMarkers, long[] revisionTimestamps, then we could do a merge sort
 *       of the leaves from the (ordered) view and then do a parallel build
 *       segment from the backing representation. We could do that build step in
 *       java or on a GPU.
 * 
 * @todo GPU parallel builds. Once we have the data in a bunch of byte[][]s we
 *       could conceivable get this stuff organized to the point where each
 *       tuple and child in the output B+Tree could be assigned to a thread and
 *       each leaf and node to a core on a GPU. At that point, we run the
 *       "build" in parallel. For this approach, the uncoded leaves will all
 *       wind up in memory using the same byte[]s for keys and values as the
 *       source view.
 *       <p>
 *       This approach could be carried further to code the nodes and leaves in
 *       parallel, perhaps as a 2nd GPU program. If the source view was fully
 *       buffered, then it should be released once the nodes and leaves have
 *       been coded as no more use will be made of those data.
 *       <p>
 *       While it may not improve the IO substantially, it is possible to use
 *       gathered writes if the leaves and nodes are fully buffered in memory.
 *       For the leaves, we write them in the index order. For the nodes, we
 *       write them in their pre-order traversal. The order in which we would
 *       write out the nodes and leaves should be part of the state during a GPU
 *       build regardless of whether the IO is done sequentially or as a
 *       gathered write.
 * 
 * @todo Make sure it is possible to grab the {@link IndexMetadata} and the
 *       bloom filter from the generated file in a single IO. This could be
 *       useful when the index segment files are stored on a parallel file
 *       system. [It is possible to do this since these data are contiguous and
 *       in the same region of the generated file (they both use addresses
 *       relative to the BASE of the file).]

     * <p>
     * The index segment metadata is divided into a base
     * {@link IndexSegmentCheckpoint} record with a fixed format containing only
     * essential data and additional metadata records written at the end of the
     * file including the optional bloom filter and the required
     * {@link IndexMetadata} record. The latter is where we write variable
     * length metadata including the _name_ of the index, or additional metadata
     * defined by a specific class of index.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Once all nodes and leaves have been buffered we are ready to start
     * writing the data. We skip over a fixed size metadata record since
     * otherwise we are unable to pre-compute the offset to the leaves and hence
     * the addresses of the leaves. The node addresses are written in an
     * encoding that requires active translation by the receiver who must be
     * aware of the offset to the start of the node region. We can not write the
     * metadata record until we know the size and length of each of these
     * regions (leaves, nodes, and the bloom filter, or other metadata records)
     * since that information is required in order to be able to form their
     * addresses for insertion in the metadata record.
