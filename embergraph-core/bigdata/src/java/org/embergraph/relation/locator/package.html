<p>

	Abstraction layer for identifying relations and relation containers in much
	the same manner that indices are identified (unique name and timestamp). 
	This makes it possible to materialize a view of a relation, together with
	appropriate index objects, anywhere in a federation.  Special cases provide
	for local resources, such as relations on a temporary store, and for access
	to the unisolated indices when running as an {@link com.bigdata.journal.AbstractTask}.
