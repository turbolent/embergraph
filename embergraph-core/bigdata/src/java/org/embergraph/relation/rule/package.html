<p>

    This package includes an abstraction layer for rules.  The class of rules is conjunctive query.  Negation is not supported, except
    within constraints.  There is support for reading on fused views which can be useful for
    transaction processing and truth maintenance.  The solutions for rules may be read back (query) or written onto a relation
    (insert or delete).
