/**
 * Abstract base class for implementations that use a direct buffer as a write
 * through cache to an image on the disk. This covers both the
 * {@link BufferMode#Direct}, where we use explicit IO operations, and the
 * {@link BufferMode#Mapped}, where we memory-map the image. Common features
 * shared by these implementations deal mainly with initialization of a new disk
 * image.
 * 
 * @todo write tests of the disk-only mode operations when overflowing an int32
 *       extent.
 * 
 * @todo consider a read buffer that uses a weak value cache backed by an LRU
 *       hard reference cache, which in turn evicts buffers back to a pool for
 *       reuse. The pool would bin buffers by size, keep no more than some #of
 *       buffers of a given size, and offer a service to allocate buffers of no
 *       less than a given capacity. This might reduce heap churn by recycling
 *       buffers in addition to providing minimizing the need to hit the OS disk
 *       cache, the disk buffers, or the disk platter.
