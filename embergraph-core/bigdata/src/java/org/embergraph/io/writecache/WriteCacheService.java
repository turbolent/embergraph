/**
 * A {@link WriteCacheService} is provisioned with some number of
 * {@link WriteCache} buffers and a writer thread. Caller's populate
 * {@link WriteCache} instances. When they are full, they are transferred to a
 * queue which is drained by the thread writing on the local disk. Hooks are
 * provided to wait until the current write set has been written (e.g., at a
 * commit point when the cached writes must be written through to the backing
 * channel). This implementation supports high availability using a write
 * replication pipeline.
 * <p>
 * A pool of {@link WriteCache} instances is used. Readers test all of the
 * {@link WriteCache} using a shared {@link ConcurrentMap} and will return
 * immediately the desired record or <code>null</code> if the record is not in
 * any of the {@link WriteCache} instances. Write caches remain available to
 * readers until they need to be recycled as the current write cache (the one
 * servicing new writes).
 * <p>
 * The {@link WriteCacheService} maintains a dirty list of {@link WriteCache}
 * instances. A single thread handle writes onto the disk and onto the write
 * replication pipeline (for HA). When the caller calls flush() on the write
 * cache service it flush() the current write cache is transferred to the dirty
 * list and then wait until the write cache instances now on the dirty list have
 * been serviced. In order to simplify the design and the provide boundary
 * conditions for HA decision making, writers block during
 * {@link #flush(boolean, long, TimeUnit)}.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are used by both the {@link RWStrategy} and the
 * {@link WORMStrategy}. These classes differ in how they allocate space on the
 * backing file and in the concurrency which they permit for writers.
 * <dl>
 * <dt>{@link WORMStrategy}</dt>
 * <dd>The {@link WORMStrategy} serializes all calls to
 * {@link #writeChk(long, ByteBuffer, int)} since it must guarantee the precise
 * offset at which each record is written onto the backing file. As a
 * consequence of its design, each {@link WriteCache} is a single contiguous
 * chunk of data and is transferred directly to a known offset on the disk. This
 * append only strategy makes for excellent transfer rates to the disk.</dd>
 * <dt>{@link RWStrategy}</dt>
 * <dd>The {@link RWStrategy} only needs to serialize the decision making about
 * the offset at which the records are allocated. Since the records may be
 * allocated at any location in the backing file, each {@link WriteCache}
 * results in a scattered write on the disk.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * Both the {@link WORMStrategy} and the {@link RWStrategy} implementations need
 * to also establish a read-write lock to prevent changes in the file extent
 * from causing corrupt data for concurrent read or write operations on the
 * file. See {@link #writeChk(long, ByteBuffer, int)} for more information on
 * this issue (it is a workaround for a JVM bug).
 * 
 * <h2>Checksums</h2>
 * 
 * The WORM and RW buffer strategy implementations, the WriteCacheService, and
 * the WriteCache all know whether or not checksums are in use. When they are,
 * the buffer strategy computes the checksum and passes it down (otherwise it
 * passes down a 0, which will be ignored since checksums are not enabled). The
 * WriteCache adjusts its capacity by -4 when checksums are enabled and adds the
 * checksum when transferring the caller's data into the WriteCache. On read,
 * the WriteCache will verify the checksum if it exists and returns a new
 * allocation backed by a byte[] showing only the caller's record.
 * <p>
 * {@link IAddressManager#getByteCount(long)} must be the actual on the disk
 * record length, not the size of the record when it reaches the application
 * layer. This on the disk length is the adjusted size after optional
 * compression and with the optional checksum. Applications which assume that
 * lengthOf(addr) == byte[].length will break, but that's life.
 * 
 * <h2>ReadCache</h2>
 * 
 * Without a hotList the readCache is managed naively by clearing any new
 * readCache. This potentially results in frequently accessed records being lost
 * to the cache.
 * 
 * <h2>HotCache</h2>
 * 
 * With the HotCache evicted readCaches hot records get transferred to hotList
 * and 'old' hotCaches get added to end of readCache. Pattern is needed to pluck
 * reserve hotCache from readList so that it is always possible to transfer hot
 * records from the readList.
 * <p>
 * Start with hotCache AND hotReserve.
 * 
 * If new reserve needed, because existing one is now used, try and compress new
 * readCache into current hotCache - if won't fit, then call resetWith and lose
 * those writes, cycle again, moving front hotCache to readList and compress
 * that one.
 * <p>
 * LIMIT: If we begin with full caches with above threshold hitCounts then the
 * whole list will cycle around until we hit original cache which will contain
 * records with zero hitCounts - for practical purposes ignoring any concurrent
 * reads.
 * 
 * @see WriteCache
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo There needs to be a unit test which verifies overwrite of a record in
 *       the {@link WriteCache} (a write at the same offset in the backing file,
 *       but at a different position in the {@link WriteCache} buffer). It is
 *       possible for this to occur with the {@link RWStore} if a record is
 *       written, deleted, and the immediately reallocated. Whether or not this
 *       is a likely event depends on how aggressively the {@link RWStore}
 *       reallocates addresses which were allocated and then deleted within the
 *       same native transaction.
 * 
 * @todo When compression is enabled, it is applied above the level of the
 *       {@link WriteCache} and {@link WriteCacheService} (which after all
 *       require the caller to pass in the checksum of the compressed record).
 *       It is an open question as to whether the caller or the store handles
 *       record compression. Note that the B+Tree leaf and node records may
 *       require an uncompressed header to allow fixup of the priorAddr and
 *       nextAddr fields.

     * @todo The WORM serializes invocations on this method because it must put
     *       each record at a specific offset into the user extent of the file.
     *       However, the RW store does not do this. Therefore, for the RW store
     *       only, we could use a queue with lost cost access and scan for best
     *       fit packing into the write cache buffer. When a new buffer is set

     *       that buffer first. This might provide better throughput for the RW
     *       store but would require an override of this method specific to that
