     * the <em>best</em> join ordering. For cases where the <code>static</code>
     * query optimizer produces a bad join ordering, the runtime query optimizer
     * can find join orderings which are orders of magnitude more efficient (10x
     * or 100x). For long running joins, this can translates into a savings of
     * minutes or hours.
