/**
 * Advancer for a quads index whose last key component is the "context position
 * (such as SPOC or SOPC). The advancer will skip to first possible key for the
 * next distinct triple for each quad which it visits. This is a cheap way to
 * impose a "DISTINCT" filter using an index scan and works well for both local
 * and scale-out indices.
 * <p>
 * You have to use {@link IRangeQuery#CURSOR} to request an {@link ITupleCursor}
 * when using an {@link Advancer} pattern.
