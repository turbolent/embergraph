<title>GAS Engine for Main Memory</title>

<p>
This is an implementation of the GAS API for main memory.  It is intended
to provide a fast, light-weight implementation with high concurrency.

TBD - first I want to see how well the MemoryStore of the SAIL does. It
might have plenty of hot spots, in which case we can implement something
directly over the Java concurrency collection classes.
