/**
 * Interface for encoding {@link IBindingSet}s comprised of {@link IV}s. The
 * interface is slightly more complicated than it otherwise would be due to (a)
 * {@link IVCache} and (b) the need to vector operations.
 * <p>
 * Encoding schemes tend to rely on {@link IVUtility} to provide fast and
 * efficient encode / decode. This is the same representation which is used in
 * the statement indices.
 * <p>
 * The {@link IVCache} interface may be used to associate a materialized
 * {@link BigdataValue} with an {@link IV}. In order to have efficient encode /
 * decode of {@link IV}s which preserves the {@link IVCache} information, the
 * encoding scheme also needs to store this association somewhere.
 * <p>
 * Encoders designed for the wire should store the {@link IVCache} association
 * in an inline representation. Encoders designed for main memory (for example,
 * vectored operations in hash joins) can use persistence capable data
 * structures to store the {@link IVCache} association.
