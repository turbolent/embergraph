/**
 * Interface for managing the {@link BigdataValue} cached on an {@link IV}.
 * <p>
 * This interface is designed to support the query plan generator. The
 * {@link BigdataValue} is cached when a query plan decides that the
 * materialized value is required for a downstream operator.
 * <p>
 * Both {@link IV} and {@link BigdataValue} can cache one another. The pattern
 * for caching is that you <em>always</em> cache the {@link IV} on the
 * {@link BigdataValue} using {@link BigdataValue#setIV(IV)}. However, the
 * {@link BigdataValue} is normally NOT cached on the {@link IV}. The exception
 * is when the {@link BigdataValue} has been materialized from the {@link IV} by
 * joining against the lexicon.

     * Query plans are also responsible for dropping variables once they are no
