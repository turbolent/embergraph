 * addStatement() or removeStatements() operations on the SAIL connection, as 
 * well as any inferred statements that are added or removed as a result of 
 * truth maintenance when the database has inference enabled.  Change records
 * will be sent to an instance of this class via the

 * occur on an ongoing basis as statements are added to or removed from the
 * indices.  It is the change log's responsibility to collect change records.  
 * When the transaction is actually committed (or aborted), the change log will 
 * receive notification via {@link #transactionCommited()} or
