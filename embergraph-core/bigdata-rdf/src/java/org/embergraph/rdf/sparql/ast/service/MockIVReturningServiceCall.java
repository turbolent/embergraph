/**
 * <p>
 * Service invocation interface for an external (non-bigdata) service. Data
 * interchange with the external service uses the internal {@link IBindingSet} 
 * abstraction and it is up to the implementing service to do any conversion of
 * external entities. More precisely, the service must return internal values
 * with mocked IVs, which will be automatically resolved against the database,
 * turning them into {@link IV}s. This can be understood as the most generic
 * kind of interface for interacting with external services.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In order to determine the set of mocked IVs, the service must specify the set
 * of variables for which such mocked IVs are generated. This can be understood
 * as the set of "outgoing" variables of the service, i.e. those variables
 * that are bound by executing the service call. All variables occurring in
 * the service that are not part of this set are considered incoming variables;
 * they must be bound (if at all) prior to executing the service.
