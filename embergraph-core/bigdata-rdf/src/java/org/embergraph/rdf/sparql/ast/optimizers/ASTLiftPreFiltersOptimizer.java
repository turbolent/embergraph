/**
 * Lift FILTERs which can be evaluated based solely on the bindings in the
 * parent group out of a child group. This helps because we will issue the
 * subquery for the child group less often (assuming that the filter rejects any
 * solutions). This optimizer is based on
 * {@link StaticAnalysis#getPreFilters(JoinGroupNode)}. Anything reported by
 * that method can be lifted out of the child group.
