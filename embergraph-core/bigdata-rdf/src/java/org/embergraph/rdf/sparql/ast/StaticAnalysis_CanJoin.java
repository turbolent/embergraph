     * variables from its statement patterns and a LET based on an expression
     * whose variables are known bound.
     * <p>
     * The returned collection reflects "bottom-up" evaluation semantics. This
     * method does NOT consider variables which are already bound on entry to
     * the group.
     * <p>

     * which would become bound during the evaluation of the join group are
     * reported. Caller's who wish to NOT have variables reported for OPTIONAL
     * or MINUS groups MUST NOT invoke this method for those groups.
     * <p>
     * Note: The recursive analysis does not throw out variables when part of
     * the tree will provably fail to bind anything. It is the role of query
     * optimizers to identify those situations and prune the AST appropriately.
