 * Query hint marks the operator as requiring "atOnce" evaluation. All solutions
 * will be buffered by the {@link QueryEngine} before the operator is evaluated.
 * When it is evaluated, it will receive all solutions in a single invocation of
 * that operator. However, the solutions MAY appear in multiple chunks since the
 * {@link QueryEngine} does not guarantee that the chunk will be merged before
 * the operator is invoked. This query hint is allowed in any scope. The hint is
 * transferred as an annotation onto all query plan operators generated from the
 * annotated scope.
 * <p>
 * Note: The "atOnce" hint is basically turned into <code>NOT(PIPELINED)</code>.
