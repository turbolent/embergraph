/**
 * Query hint for turning on/off a distinct filter over the triples extracted
 * from the default graph in quads mode.
 * <p>
 * By default, a DISTINCT filter is applied when evaluating access paths
 * against the default graph, for correctness reasons. The hint (or the 
 * respective system property) can be used to disabled the distinct filter,
 * in order to accelerate default graph queries. This can be done whenever
 * it is known that NO triple occurs in more than one named graph. 
 * 
 * BE CAREFUL: if this condition does not hold and the filter is disabled, 
 * wrong query results (caused by duplicates) will be the consequence.
