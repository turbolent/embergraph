<p>
This package provides an eager closure inference engine for most of the RDF and
RDFS entailments and can be used to realize entailments for owl:sameAs, owl:equivilentClass,
and owl:equivilentProperty.

<p>
The following entailment rules are NOT implemented.  In general, these tends to
conclude relatively useless information and lead to a large expansion of the KB.
<ul>
<li>rdf2</li>
<li>rdfs1</li>
<li>rdfs4a</li>
<li>rdfs4b</li>
</ul>
