     * allowed on elements describing RDF statements and serves as a
     * per-statement identifier. The value of the <code>bigdata:sid</code>
     * attribute must conform to the syntactic constraints of a blank node. By
     * re-using the value of the <code>bigdata:sid</code> attribute within
     * other statements in the same RDF/XML document, the client can express
     * statements about the statements.

     * This RDF/XML extension allows us to inline provenance (statements about
     * statements) with RDF/XML to clients in a manner which has minor impact on
     * unaware clients (they will perceive additional statements whose predicate
     * is <code>bigdata:sid</code>). In addition, clients aware of this
     * extension can submit RDF/XML with inline provenance.
     * <p>

     * <pre>
     * &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://www.foo.org/A&quot;&gt;
