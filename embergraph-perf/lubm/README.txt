The LUBM benchmark can be downloaded from [1].  Directions on its use are
available from the project home page.  You can download a modified version of
the LUBM benchmark which can make it a bit easier to use with bigdata from [2].
Please contact the project maintainers if you have questions about this modified
version of the LUBM benchmark.  See [3] and [4] for information about running
LUBM with bigdata.
