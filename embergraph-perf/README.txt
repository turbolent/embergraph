This module contains drivers for a variety of data sets and benchmarks used as
part of a performance test suite.

Note: You must run "ant bundleJar" in the top-level directory first.  This will
build the bigdata code base and bundle together the various dependencies so they
will be available for the ant scripts in this module.
