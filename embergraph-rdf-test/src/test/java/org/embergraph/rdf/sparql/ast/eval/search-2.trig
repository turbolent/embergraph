# Test using example based on <a href="http://www.ec-securehost.com/SIAM/SE17.html">
# Understanding Search Engines </a> by Barry and Browne. I recommend the book as
# a good overview of search engine basis and an excellent reader for latent semantic
# indexing (Barry was one of the original people involved with LSI).
# There is a worksheet <code>src/architecture/search.xls</code> that gives the 
# background for this test.  There is also a detailed example in the full text
# index search code.
