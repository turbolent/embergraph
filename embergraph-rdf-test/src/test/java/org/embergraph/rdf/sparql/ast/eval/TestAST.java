   * Unit test developed to demonstrate a problem where the incorrect materialization requirements
   * are computed.
   *
   * <p>I just happened to run into an issue dealing with materialization. Say I have a constraint
   * that needs materialization, <code>Str(...)</code> If that constraint has as its arg another
   * constraint: <code>Coalesce (?x,?y)</code> [this returns the first none null value in the list
   * of ?x,?y]
   *
   * <p>Its seems that the logic that determines the extra materialization steps doesn't handle the
   * fact that Coalesce (?x,?y) doesn't need any materialization, so never sets the {@link
   * INeedsMaterialization} interface, so the result of that valueExpression is going to be either
   * ?x or ?y, and Str does need those variables materialized, but the materialization steps would
   * never have seem that lists of terms(?x,?y) as something that needs materialization. Does the
   * fact that a ValueExpression returns a non computed IV value, ie returns one of its arguments,
   * have to be captured in order to somehow handle this?
   *
   * <pre>
   *
   * QueryType: SELECT
   * SELECT VarNode(index)
   *   JoinGroupNode {
   *     StatementPatternNode(VarNode(s), ConstantNode(TermId(4U)), ConstantNode(TermId(2U)), DEFAULT_CONTEXTS)
