# The variable ?g in GRAPH ?g is overshadowed by SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?s) AS ?x),
# so ?g in GROUP BY ?g is essentially a different variable and a singleton.
# Since it's not instantiated, the aggregation is applied to a single group of 
# 2 different bindings for graph1 and 3 different bindings for graph2.
