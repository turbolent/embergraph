/**
 * An implementation of a Blueprints Graph that implements immortality using
 * the RDR specification.
 * 
 * Modeling vertices
 * <<:v1 rdf:type :Vertex>> :timestamp "t1" .
 * 
 * Modeling element properties
 * <<:v1 :p1 "val1">> :timestamp "t1" .
 * <<:v1 :p1 "val2">> :timestamp "t2" .
 * 
 * Modeling edges

 * Two distinct edges between :v and :v2 with the same edge label.  Totally
 * legal in Blueprints.
 * :v1 :knows :v2 .
 * <<:v1 :knows :v2>> :id :e1 .
 * <<:v2 :knows :v2>> :id :e2 .
 * 
 * Created at different times.
 * :e1 :timestamp "t1" .
 * :e2 :timestamp "t2" .
 * 
 * With different properties.
 * <<:e1 :p1 "foo">> :timestamp "t1" .
 * <<:e2 :p1 "bar">> :timestamp "t2" .
 * 
 * Modeling a deleted property:
 * 
 * <<:v1 :p1 :null>> :timestamp "t3" .
 * 
 * Multiple values for the same property with the same timestamp implies a list:
 * 
 * <<:v2 :p2 "v1">> :timestamp "t1" .
 * <<:v2 :p2 "v2">> :timestamp "t1" .
 * <<:v2 :p2 "v3">> :timestamp "t1" .
 * 
 * Pure append writes - no removal of old property values.
