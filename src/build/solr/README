This is an example application setting up Solr. It is used internally for
setting up the Solr index as part of the testing procedure for the external
fulltext search feature documented at

> http://wiki.blazegraph.com/wiki/index.php/ExternalFullTextSearch

The project is taken from

- https://github.com/pkainulainen/maven-examples
- http://www.petrikainulainen.net/programming/maven/running-solr-with-maven/

and licensed under Apache 2.0 (see attached LICENSE file).

It is hooked in into CI as follows:

- Call "mvn jetty:stop; mvn clean; mvn jetty:run" before running the tests starts the server (stop and clean redundantly, in case there were problems in prior run)
- Call "curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/update?commit=true' --data-binary @/bigdata-rdf/src/test/org/embergraph/rdf/sparql/ast/eval/fts-solr-collection.xml -H 'Content-type:application/xml'" loads the test data into Solr
- Call "mvn jetty:stop; mvn clean" cleans up
