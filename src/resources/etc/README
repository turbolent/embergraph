	Server and client setups for ntp so that the cluster remains on a common
	clock.  The embergraph services rely on timestamps generated by the transaction

	clock is very convenient for logging and it makes it much easier to interpret
	the performance counters if they are are using timestamps drawn from a synchronized
	clock.
