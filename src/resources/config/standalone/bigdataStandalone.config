 * While zookeeper is started automatically, you MUST start jini before running

 * values are substituted by the installer and is unusable until those variables

     * moved around as necessary to ensure hosts running data
     * service(s) are neither under nor over utilized.  Data services
     * can be very resource intensive processes.  They heavily buffer
     * both reads and writes, and they use RAM to do so.  They also
     * support high concurrency and can use up to one thread per index
     * partition.  How many cores they will consume is very much a
     * function of the application.
     *
     * Zookeeper services use a quorum model.  Always allocate an odd
     * number.  3 gives you one failure.  5 gives you two failures.
     * Zookeeper will sync the disk almost continuously while it is
     * running.  It really deserves its own local disk.  Zookeeper
     * also runs in memory.  Since all operations are serialized, if
     * it starts swapping then peformance will drop through the floor.
     *
     * Jini uses a peer model.  Each service registers with each
     * registrar that it discovers.  Each client listeners to each
     * registrar that it discovers.  The default jini core services
     * installation runs entirely in memory (no disk operations, at
     * least not for service registration). A second instance of the
     * jini core services provides a safety net.  If you are using
     * multicast then you can always add another instance.
