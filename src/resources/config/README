This directory contains some sample configuration for a embergraph federation
and default configurations for logging and java permissions.

embergraphStandalone.config - A sample configuration file for a workstation.

embergraphCluster.config - A sample configuration file for a 3-node cluster.

embergraphCluster.config - A sample configuration file for a 16-node cluster.

log4j.properties - A default log4j configuration file for use by the embergraph
				   clients and services.
				   
logging.properties - A default Java logging configuration.  This may be used
					 to control the log levels for jini/river, which uses
					 java logging rather than log4j.

log4jServer.properties - A default log4j configuration file if you decide to
					     use the log4j SimpleSocketServer to aggregate log4j
					     messages from the federation.
					     
policy.all - A default java permissions file.  This file grants ALL permissions.
			 You may specify a more rigorous security policy.
