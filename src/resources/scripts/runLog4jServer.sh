# A server that writes log4j messages onto stdout.
#
# Note: You need a log4j "server" configuration file for this.  It
# only needs to specify the appender (where to write the stuff) and
# the layout.  You should control what gets logged in the log4j
# configuration file used by the applications generating the log events
# so that you don't spam the network with log events that will not be
# logged by the server.
#
# Note: This can also be started automatically on the configured host
# from the main embergraph configuration file.
#
# Note: JAVA_OPTS is ignored since it specifies the log4j configuration
# and we do not want to use that here.
