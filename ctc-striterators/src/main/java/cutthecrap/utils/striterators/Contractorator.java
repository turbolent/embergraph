/*
 * A Contractorator is the reverse of an Expanderator. A Contractorator takes a source Iterator, and
 * consumes elements from it in batches by passing to the Contractor which returns an object when
 * ready. It is upto the Contractor to handle termination conditions. For example, it might batch
 * consume the objects ten at a time with some summary info, but handle that there may be less than
 * ten elements in the final summary.
 *
 * <p>A Contractor could also be used to chunk up a number of objects for serialization, perhaps for
 * network transmission. Such a pattern might be used with an Expander on the other side to
 * deserialize into an iterator.
