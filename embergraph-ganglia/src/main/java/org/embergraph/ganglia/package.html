This package provides a full implementation of the ganglia protocol, including
the ability to listen and report on metrics, metadata, and metadata requests.
<p>
Applications embed a {@link com.bigdata.ganglia.GangliaService} and participate in a ganglia network.
The {@link com.bigdata.ganglia.GangliaService} provides hooks which an application can use to register
{@link com.bigdata.ganglia.IGangliaMetricsCollector}s.  Applications can provide metadata declarations
for custom metrics by implementing the {@link com.bigdata.ganglia.IGangliaMetadataFactory} interface.
